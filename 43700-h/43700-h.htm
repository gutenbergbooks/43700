<h2>THE QUIVER.</h2>

<h3>THE EMPEROR'S VISIT TO THE HOLY LAND.</h3>

<p class="cap_1">Few projects of Church extension
have attracted so much attention
as the forthcoming opening
of the Lutheran church in Jerusalem:
a movement which has
been zealously pushed forward
by his Imperial Majesty the
Kaiser of Germany and King of Prussia,
and will be happily consummated by an
imposing ceremony, at which his Majesty
and his illustrious consort will be the
central figures, just about the time that
this number reaches its thousands of
subscribers. So important is the movement,
and with such close attention has
it been watched by the religious bodies
of England, that a special representative
was sent to Berlin, who was fortunate
enough to be received by some most distinguished
Personages and kindly furnished
with many details of the scheme,
and all the information that it was
possible to give&mdash;so much in advance as
the exigencies of a monthly periodical
demand.</p>

<p>It will be as well to first speak of the
requirements for a new Lutheran church
in Jerusalem. For a great many years
there has been a considerable German
colony in the city, its members steadily
augmenting year by year. In the time of
Frederick William IV. of Prussia a joint
Protestant bishopric (German and English)
was established, the right of appointment
to lie with each country alternately. The
first Bishop was a converted German Jew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
holding orders in the English Church;
two others succeeded him, and then in 1886
Prussia withdrew from the agreement.</p>

</div>

<p>Nearly twenty years previous to this
latter date the Sultan had presented
to King William I. a disused building,
which formerly was the property of the
Knights of St. John, in order that a
Protestant Lutheran church might be
erected on the site. For some reason,
the work was delayed for a considerable
period, and the members of the German
Evangelical Church have been worshipping
in a small temporary chapel,
by the side of which the handsome new
church has been reared. The work has
been carried on by a pastor and an
assistant teacher,
and there has also
been a good school
in conjunction
with it. The
foundation stone
of the church was
laid on October
31st, 1893, and it
was thought the
consecration
would take place
in 1897; but things
were not in readiness,
and so the
event was fixed
for October 31st
of this year&mdash;the
anniversary of the
birth of the Evangelical
Church,
being the day on
which Luther
nailed his thesis
to the church door
in Wittenberg.</p>

<p>The Kaiser and
Kaiserin have long
cherished a wish
to visit the Holy
City and tread the
land which Christ
trod when on
earth; and no
better opportunity
could possibly
occur than when
a new Lutheran
church was about
to be consecrated.
Both their Majesties
have done
much&mdash;not only by
rightly using the
immense influence
which they possess, but also financially&mdash;to
further Church work; and, apart from
any other cause, the opening of this
sacred building for the use of their
countrymen in a foreign land could not
fail to enlist their sympathetic interest.
The undertaking is a pious and domestic,
and <em>not</em> a political, one, spite of several
assertions to the contrary; and all who
have the cause of true religion at heart
cannot but rejoice that there will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>

Saviour will be proclaimed to the residents
of God's chosen land.</p>

<p>Their Imperial Majesties will leave
Berlin by special train for Venice, where
a brief rest will be taken previous to the
embarkation on the royal yacht <em>Hohenzollern</em>.
The dignitaries of the Lutheran
Church and invited personages will travel
in another direction. Leaving Berlin by
train, they embark on the <em>Midnight Sun</em>
(an English vessel flying the English flag)
at Trieste; thence they will proceed
to Alexandria. Having explored that
city, they will visit Cairo, and thence,
returning to Alexandria, they will go
on to Jaffa, and so through Palestine
to Jerusalem, where they arrive about
midday on October 25th. The next few
days will be spent in viewing the city
and neighbourhood, and on the 31st
the entire party will be present at the
formal opening of the "Erl&#246;ser-Kirche"
in the presence of the Kaiser and
Kaiserin.</p>

</div>


<p>But I wish more particularly to draw
your attention to the route taken by
their Majesties, as this was particularly
pointed out to me in Berlin. Venice&mdash;the
principal port on the Adriatic&mdash;will
naturally claim some share of the interest
of the Imperial couple, and the
Palace of the Doges, dating from the
fourteenth century, with its many historical
and awful associations; the
famous cathedral of St. Mark&mdash;a venerable
building of the eleventh century,
rich in cupolas and mosaics, and marble
columns to the number of five hundred&mdash;as
well as other renowned places, will be
visited.</p>

<p>At Venice their Majesties will go on
board for a voyage of four days down
the Adriatic, and up in a northerly
direction through the Dardanelles and
Sea of Marmora, direct to Constantinople
and the Golden Horn. Here the
Sultan has made great preparations for
their reception. Special buildings are
being erected, old roads widened, and
new roads made; moreover, all streets
to be traversed by the Imperial party
are being properly paved&mdash;not before it
was requisite&mdash;thousands of gas-jets are
being added to the meagre number which
have hitherto done duty, and the Yildiz
Palace has been completely overhauled
and refitted. In short, Abdul Hamid is
incurring tremendous expense in order
to entertain his distinguished visitors
right regally. The sojourn will extend
over several days, and many places will
be visited, including the royal palaces&mdash;which
abound in Constantinople&mdash;the
mosques, tombs, towers, and bazaars;
and as their Majesties will be in the
city on a Friday, the "Selamlik," or
Sultan's procession to the mosque, will
be included in the programme.</p>

<p>On leaving Constantinople, the Imperial
yacht will steam round Asia Minor to
the Syrian coast, passing many attractive
places, amongst which may be
mentioned the Plains of Troy and the
Isle of Patmos. A run of about three
days will bring them to Kaiffa, more
generally known as Haifa. Here the
Kaiser and Kaiserin will land about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
midday on October 25th, at the special
new landing-stage which has lately been
erected for the purpose. The first stone
of this was laid amidst much ceremony
by the Mutessarif of Acre, in the presence
of the entire Consular body, the troops,
and all the local notabilities. The
ceremony was, of course, a Mohammedan
one, a sheep being sacrificed
upon the stone, and the blessing of
Allah invoked upon the coming Imperial
guests.</p>

</div>

<p>Once landed at Haifa, thenceforth the
Imperial expedition will be entirely under
the guidance of Messrs. Thomas Cook
and Son, the well-known tourist agents,
Mr. Cook himself personally conducting
the party to Jerusalem. The Sultan had
previously offered tents, horses and
carriages for the journey, but these the
Emperor at first declined, as he was
anxious to avoid giving any political significance
to an expedition undertaken
solely on religious grounds, and for the
purpose of the formal opening of the
Church of St. Saviour or the Redeemer.
At the earnest solicitation of the Sultan,
he, however, finally consented to use
horses, mules, carriages, and wagons provided
by the Turkish monarch. The
journey will be performed in true Oriental
style, everything else necessary being
furnished by Thomas Cook and Son.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>The Landing-Place of the Imperial Party.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Kaiser will make the journey on
horseback, the Kaiserin in an open
carriage. The route is to be exactly the
same as that followed by ordinary
tourists, and the entire party will camp
out at night in the usual way. The first
day's journey will occupy nine or ten
hours, and tents will be pitched for the
night outside C&#230;sarea, in full view of the
Mediterranean. Thence the party will
ride to Jaffa, a journey of ten hours.
The town is beautifully situated, and
extensively planted with orange groves.
There is a good carriage road from
it direct to Jerusalem, and a railway,
which was opened some six years
since. The Imperial party will spend
the night under canvas outside the
city, the view of which has an added
interest, inasmuch as there is within its
walls a considerable German colony. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a><br /><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
remainder of the journey to Jerusalem
will be carried out in the same manner
over ground that is scripturally historical
and highly picturesque, passing as it
does over the Plains of Sharon, by Lydda
and Emmaus&mdash;where Christ walked with
His disciples after the Resurrection&mdash;and
so on through the Valley of Ajalon, by
Kirjath and Jesrun; arriving at Jerusalem
on Saturday, October 29th, where tents
will be pitched on ground acquired by
the Evangelical Jerusalem Fund.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE JAFFA GATE AT JERUSALEM.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>From here the Emperor and Empress go on foot to the Holy Sepulchre.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The actual entrance of the procession
into the city will be imposing, but, once
within the Jaffa Gate, the Kaiser and
Kaiserin purpose going on foot to
the Holy Sepulchre, with an entire absence
of any State surroundings. The
route from the gate to the Sepulchre
has been entirely renovated for their
Majesties by the Sultan. Needless to
say, this block of buildings containing
the Chapel of the Sepulchre is surrounded
by much that is legendary, and has been
the scene of many and fierce contentions.
Now it is under the protection of the
Sultan, and Moslem soldiers guard it,
and are stationed within the vestibule
to keep order amongst the various
Christian pilgrims who visit it. Various
chapels credited to various nations are
within its portals, the Church of the
Sepulchre being, of course, the chief place
of interest.</p>

<p>The rotunda of the sepulchre is the
principal part of the building. In the
centre of the adjoining vestibule, or
Angel's Chapel, lies the stone which is
said to be that which the angel rolled
away from the mouth of the sepulchre;
then by passing through a lower door
you enter the Chapel of the Sepulchre;
it is very small, only holding three or
four persons at one time. Very much
controversy has taken place regarding
the correctness of the site of the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Sepulchre. It must of necessity be an
uncertain matter, as the course of the
city wall has not been clearly ascertained,
and it seems an undoubted fact
that in the fourth century the actual
site of the tomb was completely lost
sight of. Pilgrims who visited Jerusalem
at that period centred their entire interest
on the place of the Ascension of
the Lord, worshipping and revering the
living, and not the dead, Christ.</p>

<p>It is perhaps hardly necessary here to
point out the difference between ancient
and modern Jerusalem. Many of the
old landmarks are still in existence,
some of which I shall have occasion to
mention later. There is a large German
colony now resident there, and during
his Majesty's visit he will receive representatives
of this colony at the German
Consulate.</p>

<p>Sunday will be a memorable day for
the expedition, the first event being the
attendance at morning service in the
Church of the Nativity at Bethlehem, to
be followed by the opening of an orphanage
for Armenian children.</p>

<p>In the afternoon certain sacred places
on the Mount of Olives will be visited.
The entire Mount is replete with interest,
for there is no other place which
was frequented so much by Christ
when on earth. It is a significant fact
that, so far as can be ascertained from
the Scriptures, Jesus never spent one
night within the precincts of Jerusalem,
but was wont to spend them on the
Mount of Olives.</p>

<p>The Brook Kedron and the valley of
Jehoshaphat are each near, and are
amongst the places to be visited by the
Kaiser and the Kaiserin on that special
Sunday. But as interesting as any
event of the day will be an open-air
service to be held on the Mount, attended
by their Majesties, the whole of
the personages forming the expedition,
and the German settlement in Jerusalem.
The bands of the royal yacht and
the escorting squadron, which will have
journeyed up from Haifa for the purpose,
will perform the musical part of
the service.</p>

</div>

<p>The next day&mdash;Monday, the 31st&mdash;the
consecration of the Church of the
Redeemer in the M&#226;rist&#226;n will take
place; the ceremony will be somewhat
imposing, as a large number of clergy
and distinguished personages will be
taking part in it. The list of representatives
who will be present reads as
follows:&mdash;The members of the Evangelical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Church Council specially formed for the
Jerusalem expedition; the representatives
of the German Evangelical Ecclesiastical
Governments; the invited Foreign
Church Corporations; the Knights of the
Order of St. John; the invited representatives
of the missionary societies who
are working in Palestine and Syria; the
Gustave Adolf Society; the whole of the
Evangelical Church in Jerusalem; their
Imperial Majesties and suite. I may say
that everyone present who has gone out
from Germany will wear a decoration
that has been specially designed, known
as the Jerusalem cross; these, in fact,
will be worn the whole route of the
journey. The military element will be
in the minority, consisting only of about
sixteen men, eight of them belonging to
the Imperial Body Gendarmerie, and
eight to the Kaiserin's bodyguard; these,
however, will not travel up with the
Imperial party, having gone out from
Berlin some little time beforehand to
accustom themselves to the habits of the
country.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">THE NEW LUTHERAN CHURCH, JERUSALEM.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Immediately subsequent to the ceremony
at the church the Kaiser and
Kaiserin will start for a two or three
days' visit to places of interest around
Jerusalem, commencing by riding to
Jericho, which will take about six
hours. The Imperial party will halt
there for the night, camping at the
foot of Jebel Harantel.</p>

<p>On the succeeding day visits will be
paid to the Dead Sea and the Jordan,
the latter one of the most wonderful
rivers of the world, with a history
running through the entire Bible. Various
other places of much interest will
be seen, and then their Majesties return
to Jerusalem, going back to the
coast by train, and taking ship again
at Jaffa for Haifa.</p>

<p>From here they will visit Nazareth&mdash;which
is memorable as the home of
Jesus. It is still a flourishing place,
partly built on rocky ridges. There is a
Latin chapel which is supposed to be
built over the workshop of Joseph; also
a small chapel known as the Table of
Christ, which is merely a vaulted chamber
containing the table at which the
Saviour and His disciples
sat. Tiberias and the Sea
of Galilee will be visited.
Bethsaida, the birthplace
of some of Christ's disciples,
and other small places<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
in the vicinity, will each come in for a
share of attention.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A PRESENT-DAY VIEW ON THE JORDAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Proceeding northward, the expedition
will view other places, but none, perhaps,
so beautiful as one at which they will
make a brief stay&mdash;Damascus, the oldest
city in the world. It is situated on the
western side of the great plain, at an
elevation of two thousand two hundred
and sixty feet above the level of the sea,
and is beautiful beyond all description.
On an elevated part of the Anti-Libanus,
which rises to a height of nearly four
thousand feet, there is erected a dome of
victory, from which the best view of the
city and the seven rivers can be obtained,
as also of the white-streaked mountains,
the chocolate plain, and the rich and
varied colours of the foliage of the trees.
Within the city stands a citadel and a
palace. Damascus has seventy mosques,
and about one hundred and fifty other
places of worship in addition; and each of
the principal religious communities occupy
different parts of the city. In the same
way different industries are carried on,
each in their own quarters exclusively,
having their own bazaars for the sale of
goods. The place is highly prosperous,
and its appearance is, as I have said,
extremely beautiful. Thence the Kaiser
and Kaiserin will journey on to Egypt,
seeing Alexandria, Cairo, and going up
the Nile; but here space forbids us
following them.</p>

<p>It is a visit which cannot fail to
impress all; the Kaiser himself to no
ordinary extent, considering his remarkable
power of grasping the religious and
romantic elements of ancient history and
its famous scenes. What he will see will
stir his heart to no ordinary degree,
sensitive as is his mind to all such
impressions. It must also sensibly appeal
to the cultured members of every
religious community, and all will watch
this Imperial pilgrimage with unusual
interest, and wish for it a happy and
prosperous finale.</p>

<p>I cannot close this without tendering
my respectful thanks for the gracious
kindness accorded me in Berlin, and for
the valuable assistance rendered me by
Dr. Barkhausen, the President of the
Evangelical Church Council for the
Jerusalem Expedition, this gentleman
being chiefly responsible for the entire
arrangements.</p>

<p class="cap_1">Mr. Graydon and his
daughter Pamela
were jogging leisurely
home from the little
market town of Lettergort.
There was
no reason to hurry,
and if there had been,
Frisky, the little fat
pony, whose frisky
days were long over,
would not have been
aware of it.</p>
</div>

<p>It was very hot, a
morning of late summer;
but Pamela's creamy cheeks were as
cool as the firm petals of a lily. She bore as
if accustomed to it the jog-trot of the pony
and the frequent ruts into which their
chariot bumped, flinging her from the seat
as though she were the football in a hotly
contested game.</p>

<p>Mr. Graydon kept up a contented whistling
when he was not commenting on the fields
and the cattle as they passed. That had been
a long, hot summer, and for once in a
century people had begun to long for the
patter of rain on the leaves.</p>

<p>"Woa, Frisky&mdash;woa, little lad! That's a
nice colt of Whelan's down there by the
sally-tree. Do you see, Pam? Now, I hope
the poor fellow will get a handful of money
for it. He'll need it this summer," Mr.
Graydon would say.</p>

<p>Or, again, it would be a farmer going
their own way from Lettergort.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, John."</p>

<p>"Good-morning, your honour. How did the
calves do wid your honour?"</p>

<p>"I'm not complaining, John. Murray of
Slievenahoola gave me thirty shillings apiece
for them. It was as much as I hoped for."</p>

<p>"Aye, they wor but weanlin's. An' 'tis no
use keepin' stock this summer."</p>

<p>"How did you do with the heifers, John?"</p>

<p>"Didn't get the price of their feed, your
honour. Wirra! 'tis a desperate summer.
The hay wasn't worth cuttin', and the oats
is pitiful."</p>

<p>Again, it would be a labourer with a scythe
on his shoulder whom Mr. Graydon would
stop to ask after his household concerns.
Everywhere they passed a smile followed Mr.
Graydon's broad back in its faded homespuns.</p>

<p>"'Tis a rale pleasant word he has in his
mouth, God bless him! an' him a rale gentleman
an' all," followed him from many a
cottage-door.</p>

<p>"You've done your marketing, Pam," said
her father, turning to her.</p>

<p>"I'd plenty of time, dad, while you chatted
to your million acquaintances."</p>

<p>"And sold my calves, Pam."</p>

<p>"You might have sold a thousand in the
time."</p>

<p>"Well, well, Pam, it is my little world, you
see. I hope the perishable things won't be
broken when we come to the rut by Murphy's
gate. 'Tis a foot and a half deep at least.
Johnny Maher ought really to mend this
road."</p>

<p>"You ought to make him, dad. What's
the good of being a magistrate?"</p>

<p>"What indeed, Pam! Sure, I never get a
job done for myself. There's old Inverbarry
now, and he a lord, and he's getting the
private road through his park mended at the
public expense. And he as rich as Cr&oelig;sus,
the old sinner!"</p>

<p>Mr. Graydon rubbed his hands with benevolent
amusement. His daughter glanced
at him with a pucker between her white
brows. The violet-blue eyes under curling
black lashes exactly reproduced her father's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
though at this moment the expressions were
widely different.</p>

<p>"You're too easy-going, dad. You should
make Johnny Maher mend the road."</p>

<p>Mr. Graydon dropped a rein to pull one of
his daughter's silky black curls.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't be having me too hard on
the poor fellow, and he with a sick wife
and an old mother and a pack of children.
Eh, little Pam?"</p>

<p>Pamela shook her head severely, and the
red mouth, which had drooped at the corners
when she was serious, parted over white
teeth in a laugh fresh as a child's.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img016.jpg" width="450" height="461" alt="calves" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"How did the calves do wid your honour?"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"You've no conscience, dad, any more
than Lord Inverbarry or Johnny Maher.
You're conniving at their wrongdoing, you
see."</p>

<p>"Maybe I am, Pam&mdash;maybe I am. Only I
don't suppose it seems wrongdoing to them&mdash;at
least, not to Johnny Maher, poor fellow.
Inverbarry ought to know better."</p>

<p>They jogged along for a few minutes till
there was another jolt. Simultaneously there
was a crash at their feet, and Mr. Graydon
pulled up with an exclamation.</p>

<p>"There goes some of your crockery, Pam.
I hope it's not the lad's looking-glass."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Pam, with a sigh of
despair. "Perhaps now you'll get Johnny
Maher to see to the road. If it's his looking-glass,
he'll have to shave as Mick St. Leger
used, with the lid of a can for his looking-glass."</p>

<p>"Ah, poor Mick was used to our ways.
He didn't mind. But this is a public-school
man. We'll have to furbish up for him, little
Pam, and put our best foot foremost, eh?"</p>

<p>"It looks like it," said Pam, gazing down
at the jumbled parcels at her feet. "I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
tell you what it is," she said: "it's the glass
for his bedroom window. It is all in
smithereens. He'll have to put up with the
brown-paper panes, as Mick St. Leger did."</p>

<p>"Never mind, never mind. The lad's a
gentleman, and he'll see we're gentlefolk,
though we're as poor as church mice. He
won't mind, you'll see, Pam; gentlemen
never do mind these things."</p>

<p>"You're thinking of Mick still, dad. You
forget that Gwynne man who wouldn't stay
because he got nothing but potatoes for
three days. As if we could help the roads
being frozen and Frisky not being able to
get to Lettergort! Do you remember
Gwynne's face over the potato-cake the
third day? Yet I'm sure Bridget had done
her best. What with potatoes in their
jackets, and mashed, and with butter, and
without, and in a salad, and at last in a
cake, I'm sure there was no sameness about
the diet."</p>

<p>"Gwynne was a&mdash;well, of course, he was
a gentleman, but as disagreeable as a gentleman
can be. Besides, Pam, potatoes probably
didn't agree with him; they don't
with everyone, you know, and Gwynne was
dyspeptic. I don't know what the lads are
coming to. In my young days we didn't
even know the word dyspepsia, much less
the thing."</p>

<p>"Gwynne was hateful," said Pamela. "He
expected us to kill the chickens for him when
every single chicken was a pet, and so tame,
dear things! that they would walk into the
drawing-room and perch on your knee."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that's why Gwynne wanted them
killed," said Mr. Graydon.</p>

<p>"Nasty thing!" said Pamela. "I was
glad when we saw his back. He couldn't
bear the dear dogs lying on his bed either,
though Mary told him it was a proof of their
friendliness towards him. He fired his bootjack
after Mark Antony, you remember, and
though it's not easy to stir up Mark Antony,
yet I'm glad he had the spirit to go for
Gwynne's legs."</p>

<p>"Mark Antony had been burying bones under
Gwynne's pillow, my dear."</p>

<p>"Only because it was a wet day, and he
never liked to go out in the rain. I daresay
if he'd had time he'd have removed the bones
to the garden. However, I don't suppose
this youth will be like Gwynne. What do
you think, dad?"</p>

<p>"His father was the best fellow ever stepped
on shoe-leather. If the lad is like him, we
shan't complain. What a handsome, dashing
fellow he was! I can see him now in his
scarlet and gold lace that night at Lady
Westbury's ball, where I first met&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off suddenly with a little sigh.
"That was another world, Pam."</p>

<p>"A world well lost&mdash;was it not?&mdash;dad."</p>

<p>"Aye, a world well lost, little girl."</p>

<p>It was plain to see that a tender intimacy
existed between this father and daughter.</p>

<p>"I daresay he'll find my ways rather old-fashioned,
Pam. It was an odd thing that
his father should have remembered me, and
have wished the lad to come to me."</p>

<p>"It would have been odd if he hadn't," said
Pam shortly.</p>

<p>"There are new ways and new methods in
the world since I was at Oxford. I daresay
the lad'll find me rather rusty in my knowledge."</p>

<p>"You'll teach over his head, as you always
do, and you'll get great delight out of it.
You'll forget all about your pupil, and you'll
go mouthing Greek poetry till we think downstairs
that the study chimney is on fire. And
while you're growling and thundering the youth
will be making caricatures of you under the
table, or cutting his name deep in the oak of
your precious study table."</p>

<p>"Is that my way, little Pam?"</p>

<p>"That's your way, dad. There was never
one of your pupils that could follow you, only
little Sells, and he died young, poor boy!"</p>

<p>"Ah, little Sells. I am proud of Sells. He
died fighting the small-pox with all the heroic
soul in his little body. He had the making
of a fine scholar."</p>

<p>"Never mind, dad. None of us can do more
than die heroically. And Sells would always
have been a poor curate. They'd never have
made him a bishop."</p>

<p>"I suppose not, poor lad! Scholarship
doesn't count for much, Pam."</p>

<p>"Or you wouldn't be here, dad."</p>

<p>"I'd always be in the ruck, Pam; I'm
afraid I'm a worthless old fellow. From what
you say, Pam, I'm as much of a failure at the
teaching as anything else. I'm really afraid
it's true."</p>

<p>"Never mind, dad. As Mick St. Leger
said, you taught them better things. It isn't
your fault that you're over their heads."</p>

<p>"Did poor Mick say that, now?" said Mr.
Graydon, answering the first part of her
sentence. "Mick was a good boy; but no
scholarship in him. A child could beat Mick
at the Greek verbs."</p>

<p>"He was more at home with a rod or a
gun," assented Pamela. "Only for the noise
he made you'd never know he was in the
house. There was no fun he wasn't up to."</p>

<p>Mr. Graydon's face suddenly became serious.</p>

<p>"You'll remember this lad's not Mick,
Pam," he said; "you and Sylvia, I mean,
for, of course, Mary is always prudent. Don't
behave with him as if you were all boys together.
Now, that locking Mick in the hayloft,
or going with him to Whiddy Fair,
would never do with this boy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"That was five years ago, dad," answered
Pamela, looking with a demure smile at the
hem of her pink cotton frock where it covered
her shoes. "We were wild little colts of
girls, then, with our hair down our backs.
Besides, we never meant to <em>leave</em> Mick in the
hayloft; we only forgot he was there in the
delight of finding a wild bees' nest; and we
cried coming home from Whiddy Fair, we
were so tired and so hungry."</p>

<p>"Till I overtook you with Frisky, and drove
you home and comforted you."</p>

<p>"You should have spanked us, dad, and sent
Mick to the right-about."</p>

<p>"So I should. If you'd been boys, I daresay
I'd have known a better way with you.
But what can one do with little girls? Then
poor Mick. I knew it wasn't Mick's fault.
You'd been leading him astray, as usual."</p>

<p>But Frisky had pulled up suddenly at a
rather dilapidated gate, with a post falling
to pieces, and the two halves of the gate
fastened together with a piece of string. Out
of the lodge within poured a stream of
blue-eyed and chubby children, who stood
regarding Frisky and his freight with shy
and friendly smiles.</p>

<p>"Halloa, you rascals," called out Mr. Graydon,
"run and call your mother, some of you. Gone
with your father's dinner, is she? She seems
to be always gone with your father's dinner.
You can't get down to open the gate, Pam?
No, I see you can't; you're built in with
parcels round your feet. Here, take the
reins, and I'll get down myself. Only don't
let Frisky get his head, or he'll run off
with the other post, as he did with that one."</p>

<p>"Frisky is not likely to do that, dad. He's
got more sedate since those days. It was
about the same time that Sylvia and I locked
Mick in the hayloft."</p>

<p>"Five years ago, Pam? It can't be five
years ago. I'd never have left that post
unmended five years. Why, it was only the
other day I was saying I'd have over the
mason from Lettergort to mend it."</p>

<p>He had now done fumbling with the tie of
the gate, and Pamela drove into the overgrown
avenue. While he was replacing the
bit of string he kept up a running fire of
jests with the small, shame-faced children, to
which she listened with a half-smile.</p>

<p>"Dear old dad," she said to herself. "He
has been so long letting things go that he
even forgets that he has let them go. And
I'm his own daughter."</p>

<p>She took up a breadth of her pink frock and
looked at it. There was a rent of at least
three inches in it. Pamela shook her head
in mute self-reproach.</p>

<p>"It'll never do for 'Trevithick's lad,' as the
dear dad calls him. I don't suppose he's
used to young women with rents in their
frocks. And I am a young woman, and so is
Sylvia, though our own father has never
found it out."</p>

<p>As she sat waiting, a dreamy smile came to
her lips and a softness to her eyes. It was
like a prophecy of what "Trevithick's lad"
was to bring&mdash;like the dawn of love, sweet
and bitter, that was to bring Pam the hoyden
into her woman's inheritance.</p>

<p>"Come along, dear," she said with a start,
turning to her father: it seemed as if his
head-pattings of the children would never
come to an end. "Frisky's getting uneasy,
and will bolt with me and the crockery, if
you don't hurry up."</p>

<p>Her father jumped into the little cart with
a laugh.</p>

<p>"I forgot that you were waiting, Pam,
those infants have such pleasing ways. But
as for Frisky running away with you, why,
bless me! he's had time to get old since
he ran away with the post; at least, so you
say, though I should never have believed it&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"And now," said Pam, "you're going to
be turned out of house and home for the next
few days. Unhappy man, you little know
how you've carried soap and scrubbing brushes
for your own destruction."</p>

<p>Mr. Graydon gave a gasp of genuine alarm.</p>

<p>"Soap and scrubbing brushes! But what
for, Pam? I am sure everything is very
clean&mdash;except my books; and I won't have
the books touched, mind that&mdash;I won't have
my books touched."</p>

<p>"Indeed, then, and I'd advise you to say
that to Bridget yourself, for I'm sure I won't.
She's taken a fit of industry, and says she
might as well be living among haythens, wid
th' ould dust an' dirt the masther's for ever
gatherin'. 'Them ould books of his,' she says,
'would be a dale better for a rub of a damp
cloth, and then a polish up wid a duster.'"</p>

<p>"Pam!" cried the unhappy gentleman. "She
wouldn't dare put a damp cloth near my
books."</p>

<p>"She'd dare most things, would Bridget.
It's your vellum covers she's after chiefly.
She says they're unnaturally dirty."</p>

<p>She looked at the beloved face, which bore
a look of genuine dismay over its genial
ruddiness.</p>

<p>"Never mind, dad," she said. "Bridget
promises great things; but between you and
me I believe the great clearing up will just end
in what she herself calls a lick and a promise.
I don't suppose she'll ever get so far as your
possessions&mdash;I don't really believe she will."</p>

<p>"Don't let her, Pamela darling, will you?"
said her father entreatingly. "Why, good
gracious! my classics in vellum! A damp
cloth! And Bridget's damp cloth! It would
be enough to send me to an asylum."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>PREPARATIONS.</h3>


<p>"When I was at Lord Carrickmines's,"
began Bridget.</p>

<p>"Bother Lord Carrickmines!"
said Miss Sylvia Graydon. "We
know everything that happened at Lord
Carrickmines', and that can't have been
much, seeing you've lived in this house since
before I was born."</p>

<p>"When I was at Lord Carrickmines's,"
went on Bridget with a kindling eye, "the
young ladies&mdash;and sweet young ladies they
were, Miss Mabel and Miss Alice&mdash;would have
scorned to sit on the kitchen table swingin'
their feet an' givin' advice they worn't
asked for when there was work to be done
in the house. They were more likely to come
an' help&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"In their pink and blue silks, Bridget dear.
You know they always wore pink and blue
silks. Besides, I only advised you for your
good. You're going the wrong way entirely
about mending that chair. The first time
Sir Anthony sits on it he'll go flat on the
floor."</p>

<p>"Well, then, it won't be you'll go flat on
the floor, Miss Sylvy, so you needn't be
talkin' about it. There, bother the thing!
The more nails I drives in it the more it
splits, till the cracks in it is like the spokes
of a wheel. I believe 'tis you sittin' there
givin' me impudence, Miss Sylvy. Sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
it's the contrary ould thing entirely. I wish
I'd never bothered after it."</p>

<p>"Why did you, then? Why can't he sit
on his trunk, as Mick used to do? I'm sure
he can't be better than Mick."</p>

<p>"There's a deal o' differ, Miss Sylvy,
between the rank of a 'Sir' an' the rank of
a meleetia leftenant, though Mr. St. Leger was
a real nice young gentleman, when not led
into mischief by you or Miss Pamela. You
see, I learnt the differ when I was at
Lord&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what, Bridget," said Miss
Sylvia, jumping off the table, "I'll go and
pick currants in the garden. You were saying
yesterday they were dropping off their
stalks for want of picking."</p>

<p>"Aye, do, dearie. I'll be makin' jam as
soon as I get this weary cleanin' done, an'
you'll help me with the stirrin', Miss Sylvy,
an' write the labels for me?"</p>

<p>"That I will, Bridget, on condition you
give me a pot for myself."</p>

<p>Bridget looked fondly after the slender
young figure as it went out in the sunlight,
followed by a very fat bull-dog which had
been basking before the fire.</p>

<p>"There," she said to herself, "Miss Sylvy's
real willin', if you only take her the right
way. Sure, as I was sayin' to the master
the other day, you'd never miss a young
gentleman in the house as long as you'd
Miss Sylvy. Miss Pamela's real pleasant,
too, but give me Miss Sylvy, for all she's
more like a boy nor a girl. But there, a
household of females is apt to weigh on the
spirits, as I say, so it's well we have Miss
Sylvy, for the master's ever abroad or shut
up wid his musty ould books."</p>

<p>At this moment a lieutenant of Bridget's
appeared on the scene. This was Mrs.
Murphy, a stout village matron, who had
been brought in to assist in the great
cleaning up, preparatory to the arrival of the
new pupil.</p>

<p>The good woman was steaming like her
suds, of which she carried a very dirty bucketful.</p>

<p>"Well, that job's done," she observed, "an'
the room ought to be clane enough to sarve
him another twelvemonth. I don't know
what the gentry wants wid all the clanin'
at all. 'Tis meself wouldn't like ould
buckets o' suds rowled round the flure o'
my little room at home. They say washin'
flures is the cause of a many coulds. How
is the work wid ye, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"I'm not progressin' much, ma'am. I was
just tellin' Miss Sylvy that it was her
sittin' and laughin' at me was puttin' out
my hand. Sit down for a minute, ma'am,
an' have a noggin o' buttermilk to cool ye.
There's time enough to be pullin' up the
master's ould carpet that hasn't been up in
the memory o' man. He won't be home
this hour yet."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen doesn't like clanin' times, Miss
Flanagan," Mrs. Murphy observed, as she
seated herself.</p>

<p>"Indeed, they're contrairy cratures, like all
men. They like claneness, but they don't
like to be claned. See how they're always
moppin' themselves in could baths enough to
give them their end, and yet water about
their rooms is somethin' they can't endure.
When I was at Lord Carrickmines's, the
housekeeper put me, as it might be you,
ma'am, to pelt an ould bucket o' water
round his lordship's studio. He was a hasty
man, an' he caught sight o' me enterin'
the door&mdash;oh, bedad! he took the ould
blunderbuss an' promised me the contints of
it if I didn't quit."</p>

<p>"The master here's rale quiet, though. He
won't be for murdherin' you, glory be to
goodness!"</p>

<p>"I daresay he'll raise a pillalew all the
time," said Bridget philosophically, "but 'tis
no use mindin' him."</p>

<p>"Yez have great preparations anyway, an'
people's comfort all out o' the windy. I
suppose 'tis a rale grand young gentleman
yez are gettin'?"</p>

<p>"Well enough, well enough," said Bridget
loftily. "He's what ye call a baronite."</p>

<p>"Rowlin' in gould, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, ma'am, I was never curious
enough to ax his fortin'."</p>

<p>Undeterred by this glaring snub, Mrs.
Murphy went on placidly:</p>

<p>"He'll be a fine match for wan o' the
young ladies."</p>

<p>"He might be," assented Bridget, as if she
had thought of it for the first time.</p>

<p>"Miss Sylvy now'll dazzle the eyes of him
wid beauty. I wouldn't ask a greater beauty
meself if I wor a young gentleman."</p>

<p>"Oh, the beauty's there, never fear. You
wouldn't find a sweeter angel than Miss
Sylvy sittin' up in church on Sunday, wid
the feathery hat she made herself, poor lamb.
The little face of her, and the big shiny
eyes, an' the darlin' hair puffed out about
her. Och, indeed, you'd go a long way to
bate Miss Sylvia in beauty."</p>

<p>"So the young gentleman'll think, I'll be
bound."</p>

<p>"Indeed, then, I hope he won't be wastin'
his time, for if he was to come makin' love
to Miss Sylvy, 'tis as like as not she'd make
a face at him."</p>

<p>"Well, then, it'll be Miss Pamela."</p>

<p>"May be, may be. Anyhow, it won't be
Miss Sylvy, for she's just an imp of mischief,
for all she has the face of an angel. The
master calls her 'Boy.' 'I was lookin' for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
boy,' says he, 'an' 'twas herself that come.
But sure, after all,' says he, 'I'm not sure
'twas any mistake at all, at all.'"</p>

<p>"And now, Mrs. Murphy," said Bridget, with
a sudden return to authority, "I'd be obliged
to you if it was your work you was gettin'
about, an' not sittin' here idlin' all day. Stir
your lazy bones, woman, an' be off to the
master's studio, or 'tis never done 'twill be at
all."</p>

<p>"Well, indeed, ma'am," said Mrs. Murphy,
with a justly aggrieved air. "Here I wouldn't
be at all, exceptin' by your own invitation."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/img021.jpg" width="250" height="376" alt="clanin" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Gentlemen doesn't like clanin' times, Miss
Flanagan."</p></div>
</div>

<p>Bridget hurried upstairs through the quiet
house flooded with morning sunshine. Carrickmoyle
stood on a plateau, and looked away
over the bleached country and the summer-dark
coppices. It was a square house, kindly
of aspect, despite its ruinous condition, and
around it lay a rich old garden, full of damask
roses and such wealth of fruit as only come
with years to a garden.</p>

<p>An orchard, gnarled and overgrown, was
down in the hollow. A delightful place it was
to dream away a summer day, with no sound
to break the stillness save only the moan of
the wood-dove or the dropping of ripe fruit.</p>

<p>As Bridget went upstairs she paused at a
window. Below her, flitting here and there
through the raspberry canes and currant
bushes, she caught a glimpse of Sylvia's blue
frock.</p>

<p>"There she is, the lamb," muttered the old
woman, her face softening. "There she is,
wid that Mark Antony at her heels, helpin'
himself to the raspberries, I'll be bound. An'
she, pretty lamb! 'tis more she'll be atin'
thin pickin', I'm thinkin'. But never mind,
never mind, we can't be young but wance."</p>

<p>In the room intended for the new pupil Mary
Graydon, the eldest of the three girls, was
sitting, puckering her forehead over a mass of
muslin that overflowed her lap.</p>

<p>"What are you in trouble about, Miss Mary?"
asked Bridget.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to cut this into curtains
for the window at all, Bridget dear," said the
sweetest, most plaintive voice; "it's so narrow
and the window so wide."</p>

<p>"What have you got at all, child? 'Tisn't
your poor mamma's muslin slips?"</p>

<p>"It is indeed, Bridget. They were only going
to pieces where they were, and we can't afford
curtains, and I'm sure if mamma was alive
she'd tell me to 'take them.'"</p>

<p>"Indeed, then, I'm sure she would, Miss
Mary, for she was like yourself; she'd give
the clothes off her back to anyone she thought
wanted them worse. Give me the scissors,
jewel, an' I'll just cut them out for you. I
once got a prize in Major Healy's lady's sewin'-class
for cuttin'-out when I was a girl; though
you'd never believe it, to see the botch I
made of the chair I was tryin' to mend."</p>

<p>"It isn't quite the same thing, Bridget, you
know. Oh! thank you, that <em>is</em> clever. How are
you getting on downstairs?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well, Miss Mary, but 'tis aisy does
it wid that woman, Mrs. Murphy. She's a
great ould gossip of a woman; 'tis no wonder
Tim an' the childher are the shows of the
place. I was hard put to it to shut her mouth&mdash;her
tongue's longer thin my arm&mdash;an' get
her to the master's studio before he came
home."</p>

<p>"Oh, poor papa! You're surely not invading
him, Bridget?"</p>

<p>"Aye, am I. The woman's up to her
shoulders in dirty soap-suds by this time,
unless she's found someone more ready to
listen to her thin I was. There, Miss Mary,
there's the curtain; I've made a nate job of
it, haven't I?"</p>

<p>"You have indeed, Bridget. I wish you'd
teach me some of your cleverness."</p>

<p>"Arrah! what would you want with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
like? Sure, 'tis only by rayson of a little
inconvaynience that rale blood-ladies like
yourselves has to lift your hands, if it was
only to wash your faces."</p>

<p>Mary Graydon shook her head. Hers was
a face which seemed irradiated with a quiet
inward light, and her eyes were gentler than
the eyes of doves.</p>

<p>"You must teach me all you know, Bridget,
for I shall always be poor."</p>

<p>"You mane when you marry Mr. St. Leger,
Miss Mary?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded without speaking, but a
sudden rush of happy colour covered her innocent
face.</p>

<p>"Don't be thinkin' of that, my lamb. The
ould lord'll come round before that. Sure he
couldn't be as hard-hearted a naygur as he
lets on."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not, Bridget. He has a little
son of his own now, you see, and so the less
reason for forgiving papa."</p>

<p>Bridget lifted her eyes and hands.</p>

<p>"Him wid a little son indeed! Cock him up
wid a little son, an' him wid wan foot in the
grave! Well, there's no gettin' over the ways
of some people. But 'tis time for me to be
gettin' about my work, or I'll be as bad as
that Murphy woman. Just you call to me,
Miss Mary, if you want to know anything;
but don't go spoiling them eyes on Mr. Mick,
puttin' too fine work into that baronite's
curtains."</p>

<p>She went off then, and for a time there was
silence in the room, broken only by the occasional
efforts of Pamela's Irish terrier, Pat,
to better Bridget's bed-making. The windows,
brown-paper panes and all, were flung wide
open, and there was a lovely prospect of plain
and hill, and wood and river, stretching away
into the pearl-grey distances. A little wind
sang like a lullaby in the leaves of the sycamore
outside the window, and from the garden below
came a drowsy humming of bees.</p>

<p>But to the girl who sat there dreaming
dreams a scene widely different presented
itself. She saw a parched Indian plain and
a row of low white buildings. All around
there was a clearing, but beyond was the
mass of the jungle, where the jackals cried
by night and the lions roared thunderously.
Somewhere in that baking place she
saw the face she loved&mdash;the plain, honest,
devoted face of Mick St. Leger, who had
passed from the Militia to be a subaltern in
a marching regiment. Five years at least
would elapse before he came home&mdash;five
years, with all their chances of trouble and
loneliness, and, alas! of death.</p>

<p>Mary Graydon trembled over her sewing as
the longing for her lover became almost
intolerable. Then she snapped a thread off
short, and lifted her eyes in a quiet way
which had become natural to her when she
was alone. She could not know what was
happening to her dear boy under those
deadly skies; but there was One who knew
and whose love was greater still, and she
could trust that love even if its will was to
slay her.</p>

<p>There was a quick step on the stones, and
the sound of someone rushing up two steps
at a time.</p>

<p>"Oh! here you are, Molly," cried Pamela,
rushing in breathless. "We've got home,
papa and I; and the glass for these windows is
all in a smash, and three of the new tumblers,
and the youth's shaving-glass. And what do
you think, darling? The youth's coming to-day&mdash;this
afternoon. That dear old dunderhead
of a father of ours has been reading
'Thursday' for 'Tuesday,' and has just had
a telegram to undeceive him."</p>

<p>Mary lifted her hands in dismay.</p>

<p>"Dad's to meet him at Lettergort at four-thirty.
It's just as well it happened, anyhow,
for, instead of going into his study to read the
<cite>Sentinel</cite>, I've headed him off for the stables
to see if Frisky must have a shoe. So he
hasn't discovered yet the terrible havoc
among his household gods. Maybe, if we
can get things to rights before he finds out,
he'll never know his room has been cleaned at
all, at all. I'm sure Mrs. Murphy will leave
as few traces of the cleaning as possible."</p>

<p>"What <em>are</em> we to do, Pam?"</p>

<p>"Why, do nothing. It's just as well the
glass is broken, for there'd be no time to
put it in. Besides, I'm of Bridget's opinion,
that brown paper's a deal comfortabler-looking
in the could weather."</p>

<p>"But his dinner, Pamela?"</p>

<p>"Why, kill the red cock. He's been insufferable,
strutting about with his hoarse
crow, since he killed my dear bantam. Besides,
he can't live much longer; you know
he's very old."</p>

<p>"But won't he be tough? Besides, how are
we to catch him?"</p>

<p>"As to the toughness, the youth will think
it's the habit of Irish fowl. As to catching
him, I think he might be trapped in the rose-bush
opposite the hall-door, where he and his
wives have taken to roosting; and a nice
thing they've made of the rose-bush. He's so
old, poor dear! that he goes to bed while yet
the sun's high; but, mind, I'll have nothing
to say to catching him, lest it should savour
of revenge for my Dick."</p>

<p>"But, Pam, the house is upside down; and
Sir Anthony comes at four-thirty, you say?"</p>

<p>"Four-thirty his train is due. But papa
must take him a round that'll keep him till
seven. You may trust Frisky, if Frisky gets
a chance, though in the ordinary course of
things they'd arrive here from Lettergort in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
half an hour. Then the train <em>may</em> be more
late than usual, to oblige us."</p>

<p>"I suppose papa must keep him out?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, he must. It's an interesting
country and a charming day. Later on,
of course, he'll find out that Lettergort
Station is only round the corner, so to speak;
but he'll think the long drive was an
aberration of his Irish host."</p>

<p>"But won't he be tired after his long
journey?"</p>

<p>"He'll be more tired if he has to help us to
catch the red cock; that is, if we don't
succeed in surprising the poor thing."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose we'll have to ask papa
to do that. And Pam, darling, do run down
and see what Mrs. Murphy is doing in the
poor dear's study. He has always been so
happy there that it's a shame to disturb
him with the knowledge that it has been
invaded."</p>

<p>"Leave that to me. You'd say I was a
born general if you saw the way I headed
him off when he came in. I'll lock Mrs.
Murphy in, if necessary, and then make a
prodigious search for the key."</p>

<p>"Don't do that, Pam, darling."</p>

<p>"Only as a last resource. Never you fear,
I'll keep the poor darling's mind undisturbed.
You'll see he never suspects anything, even
when I ask him at lunch where I shall find
the quotation, 'Alas, unconscious of their
doom, the little infants play.'"</p>

<p>And Pamela did ask him at lunch, and the
poor gentleman gave her innocently the information
she asked. Though, as she said
afterwards, it was a shame to keep him in
the dark, for he loved a joke so dearly that
he would have enjoyed one even at his own
expense.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>SIB ANTHONY TREVITHICK.</h3>


<p>"Well, if the ould train isn't batin'
herself for bein' up to time!" said
Pat Sheehan, the porter at Lettergort
Station. "She'll draw up at
this platform twenty-five minits before she's
due be the time-table, an' an hour an' twenty-five
before her usual time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Tis Timothy Dolan that's drivin' her,"
said the person addressed, a little old woman
like a robin, with a soft little voice hardly
bigger than a bird's twitter.</p>

<p>"The power of love is wonderful," she
went on; "sure Tim's spakin' to Mrs. Doyle's
little Katty, an' he's raced the thrain so
that he can dart up an' see the little girl
while the ould ingin' is pantin' the sides
out of her like a dog after a gallop."</p>

<p>"More than punctual!" commented a young
gentleman, who was standing in a first-class
carriage, looking from the shining landscape
to the face of his chronometer.</p>

<p>He was a good-looking fellow, with honest
brown eyes and a face that told of constant
living in the open air. He was lean as a
hound, and almost as long; presumably he
would fill out, but even now his long-legged
youthfulness was not without its attractive
side.</p>

<p>As the train drew up at the platform he
pocketed his watch, and began to gather his
belongings leisurely. They seemed to be a
good many&mdash;gun-case, golf-sticks, fishing-tackle,
hat-case, rugs and umbrellas, and all
the rest of it. While he was thus engaged
a good-natured face, belonging to the red-bearded
and red-haired giant who was guard
of the train, looked in at the window.</p>

<p>"No hurry, sir, if you're not goin' on. If
you are, there'll be time to take a dander
up the town an' get a bit of dinner."</p>

<p>"Indeed? I didn't know you made a long
stop here," said the youth, pausing in his
occupation of locking a small portmanteau.</p>

<p>"No more we do. We're supposed to skelp
along wid the letters for Ballintaggart beyant
the mountains there. But you see, sir"&mdash;insinuatingly&mdash;"the
driver's gone to see his
sweetheart. That's how we got in so early.
Tim is the boy for not lettin' the grass grow
under the thrain when he has a mind. I
remember when this ould thrain was bet in
a race wid a pig; but Tim's put another
face on her."</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;indeed. And when will you start
again?"</p>

<p>"Whenever your honour likes. I wouldn't
be for hurryin' a gentleman over his dinner,
to say nothin' of Tim, that's a dacent boy,
an' deserves a good turn."</p>

<p>The traveller laughed with an enjoyment
that lit up a face grave in repose.</p>

<p>"You don't mind letting the people at Ballin&mdash;what's-its-name?&mdash;wait
for their letters?"</p>

<p>"Och, surely not. Maybe 'tis a week before
some o' them 'ud hear be chance there was
a letter for 'em at the post-office, an' be
that time every wan in the place'll know
what's in it. It'll be: 'There's a letter
below at the post-office for you, Judy, wid
an order in it for a pound from your Uncle
Con in Philadelphy'; or, 'Miss Geraghty
below at the post-office was tellin' me
there's grand news from the daughter in New
York&mdash;twins, no less, an' all doin' well.' Sure,
the people themselves is the last to hear,
barrin' the polis."</p>

<p>"But why should the police be in the
dark?" asked the young gentleman, as he
finally concluded putting his traps together.
"Here, help me out with these, please. I'm
getting off here, or I'd be delighted to fix the
hour for going on."</p>

<p>Mat Connor, the guard, beckoned to Pat
Sheehan.</p>

<p>"Here's a man 'ull run 'em anywhere you
like in his ass-cart for you, sir, an' welcome.
As I was sayin', sir, the polis has nothin' to
do but pick up news, and there's an objection
to doin' away wid their ockypation&mdash;that's
all. They're dacent men, the polis."</p>

<p>"I expected a carriage or something to
meet me."</p>

<p>Mat Connor looked up and down the
platform, where the little woman stood alone,
enjoying the excitement of the train's arrival.
Then he went to the door and looked
out. As he came back he again carefully
scanned the platform, as though he might
have overlooked such a thing as a carriage.</p>

<p>"Not a sight of one I see at all, at all,
sir. Where might you be for, if I may make
so bould as to ask?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to Mr. Graydon's, of Carrickmoyle.
I daresay he'll be here presently, as
he knows the hour the train is due."</p>

<p>"Och, Mr. Graydon'll be here, never fear.
He'll be rowlin' round in his little car in
less thin no time. The gentleman's for Mr.
Graydon's, Pat. Just get his things on the
ass-cart an' run them around before another
train's due."</p>

<p>"It is not far, then?"</p>

<p>"If you turned to the right when you
wint out, an' kep' your eyes shut, only feelin'
your way by the wall, you'd be turnin' in
at the gate of Carrickmoyle in, maybe, half
an hour. But sure, here's Mr. Graydon himself
comin' to look for you. I suspected he
wouldn't be long."</p>

<p>The young gentleman turned round and
saw coming towards him along the platform
a lively, fresh-coloured man, of fifty or thereabouts.
In spite of his old Norfolk jacket
and knickerbockers of grey homespun,
yellowed and browned with hard wear,
there was no mistaking Mr. Graydon for
anything but a gentleman. His face beamed
cordiality on the new arrival, and his blue
eyes shone with pleasure.</p>

<p>"You are welcome, my dear Sir Anthony,
very heartily welcome to Carrickmoyle!
Have you been waiting? I'm so sorry. I
made certain to be in time. Indeed, I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
an errand to do a little further, but, of
course, I turned in as soon as I saw the
train had arrived."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img025.jpg" width="450" height="410" alt="Anthony" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"You are welcome, my dear Sir Anthony."</p></div>
</div>

<p>"The train was over-punctual, sir, and I
have been very well entertained while I
waited."</p>

<p>"I daresay, I daresay. There are worse
comrades than Mat.
Many a pleasant
day's shooting I had
with Mat for companion.
Eh, Mat,
you don't forget the
night in the Moyle
river when our legs
froze waiting for
wild duck, and we
thought we'd have
to stay there till the
hot weather set us
free."</p>

<p>Mat grinned delightedly
for response.</p>

<p>"The worst of
Mat is he's a born
poacher. Doesn't respect
Inverbarry's
preserves or anybody
else's, and
isn't to be frightened,
though I tell
him Inverbarry'll
lock him up one of
these days."</p>

<p>"Not wid your
honour on the bench.
But 'tisn't me that
poaches. 'Tis the
bit of a dog. You
couldn't insinse respect
for the law
into that little baste's head wance he's put
up a hare or a partridge."</p>

<p>"Well, good-bye, Mat, good-bye. Tell the
old mother I was asking for her. How are
you, Mrs. Kelly? What's the last news
from Nora? The best, that's a good
hearing. Come along, Sir Anthony. Don't
drop any of the gentleman's things on your
way, Pat."</p>

<p>Mr. Graydon bustled his new pupil out of
the little station, and into the very disreputable
pony car, with a blissful oblivion of its
shortcomings.</p>

<p>"You won't mind coming to the village
with me till I deliver my message? I was
very near forgetting it. Then I'll have you
home in less than no time. You'll be glad
of a wash-up and a cup of tea."</p>

<p>Sir Anthony assented, but he was preoccupied,
tucking his long legs away under the
seat of the little car. When he had time
to look at his host, he found him gravely
regarding him.</p>

<p>"You are like your father, just such another
as he was at your age."</p>

<p>"I am glad you think so, sir. I am proud
to be like him."</p>

<p>"Ah, he was a fine fellow, my lad."</p>

<p>"He never forgot you, sir, and your old
friendship, though, as he said, you had chosen
to bury yourself far away from your friends.
He used to say that no man had more friends,
or deserved them better."</p>

<p>"Did he say that?" and for a second Mr.
Graydon's eyes were misty. "Ah, well! he
showed he remembered me when he wished
his boy to be in my hands."</p>

<p>"You are good to have me, sir."</p>

<p>"Not at all, my lad. I shall be very glad
of your companionship, and shall feel sometimes
as if it were Gerald Trevithick beside
me as of old instead of his boy. And your
mother? I hope you left Lady Jane well."</p>

<p>"Quite well, thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"And what did she think of her only son
burying himself in the wilds of Ireland?"</p>

<p>"She respected my father's wishes," said
the young fellow, and Mr. Graydon detected
a note of coldness in the voice which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
been so tender when he spoke of his dead
father.</p>

<p>"Ah, here we are," said Mr. Graydon, as
they turned into a tiny street of mud cabins
and drew up in front of a general shop.
"Just take the reins for a minute while I
give Mrs. Lennan my daughter's orders. Oh,
is it yourself, Mrs. Lennan? You shouldn't
have troubled to come out. You're looking
bonny in spite of the hot weather."</p>

<p>"The same to you, Mr. Graydon," said the
little rosy-cheeked woman, curtseying. "What
can I do for your honour to-day?"</p>

<p>"I've a list here as long as a woman's
tongue, Mrs. Lennan, though the tongue isn't
yours or we'd wish it to be always wagging.
Let me see&mdash;here it is: soap, candles, matches&mdash;there,
you'd better take it inside and get
Mike to read it for you. He's a fine scholar,
I hear."</p>

<p>"Indeed, then, he is, sir, though his mother
oughtn't to be talkin' about it. Thank you,
sir. I'll put the things together in less time
than you'd say them over."</p>

<p>While they waited in the village street,
Mr. Graydon beguiled the time by genial
gossip with every man, woman, and child who
came the way.</p>

<p>"How well you get on with the people,
sir," Sir Anthony could not help saying.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" said Mr. Graydon, with
a little surprise. "You see, we've known
each other so long. Things and people change
little in these out-of-the-way places."</p>

<p>"I couldn't do it, if it was to save my life.
Besides, the people where I come from wouldn't
understand it."</p>

<p>"Ah, I suppose not. We Irish are more of
a large family&mdash;which is, perhaps, the reason
why we wrangle sometimes."</p>

<p>"I don't know how you recollect all their
ailments, and the names and conditions of
their families, and all the rest of it."</p>

<p>"I am about through them so much. Your
mother would understand. I daresay she plays
the Lady Bountiful a good deal."</p>

<p>The young man's lips parted over a range
of beautifully white and strong teeth.</p>

<p>"No," he said, a little grimly. "The mater
isn't at all the district-visiting sort, I assure
you, sir."</p>

<p>With a feeling of having blundered, Mr.
Graydon changed the subject.</p>

<p>"I was glad to see your gun-case," he said.
"There's any amount of game about here.
The mountain yonder has no end of rabbits;
and there's plenty of teal, woodcock,
grouse, and partridge. Good fishing, too, in
the Moyle&mdash;the sweetest salmon-trout that
ever grilled over a clear fire; and a mile or two
away there are big salmon for the taking."</p>

<p>"Unpreserved?" cried the youth, with
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, not very strictly preserved. That
mountain yonder, Carrickduff, is part of my
singularly unprofitable property, and the
Moyle runs inside my walls."</p>

<p>"If you don't keep me too close to work, sir,
I foresee that I shall find Carrickmoyle a
paradise."</p>

<p>"There are worse places than Carrickmoyle,"
said Mr. Graydon, with a sparkle
of pleasure in his eye. "Oh, I shan't overwork
you. I believe in out-of-doors for
young fellows. When I am busy&mdash;I daresay
I shall be a little busy at times with a book
which I have had in hand some years&mdash;the
children will look after you."</p>

<p>"You have children, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, three little girls. The eldest is, I'm
afraid, becoming grown-up; but the others
are quite children, and as wild as little
hares."</p>

<p>By this time they had passed the rickety
gate and were approaching the house, the
double doors of which stood hospitably open.</p>

<p>Mr. Graydon drew up on the gravel-sweep
opposite the door.</p>

<p>"I must take Frisky round," he said, "and,
meanwhile, will you go into the drawing-room?
It is the first door on the left. I'll be back with
you in a minute, as soon as I've found little Tim
to take Frisky from me&mdash;likely as not he's playing
marbles in the paddock."</p>

<p>Sir Anthony did as he was directed. The big
hall, when he had entered it, was full of sunlight,
but otherwise bare as poverty. A big
fireplace, where the brasses tarnished and the
steel rusted; a great handsome box, intended
for billets of wood, but now coldly empty;
some dusty antlers and shields on the high
wall&mdash;these were not cheerful.</p>

<p>What was, was the sound of young laughter
proceeding from the door to the left&mdash;exuberant
laughter, full of enjoyment, accompanied with
an odd little sound of rushing hither and
thither.</p>

<p>The young fellow's face lit up as he went
forward.</p>

<p>"The children playing 'Puss in the Corner,'"
he said to himself, and went almost on tip-toe.</p>

<p>But as he reached the door he was met by a
sudden silvery shriek. Something feathery and
very hard struck him between the eyes; then
the thing dodged him, but before he could discover
what it was another missile followed; at
the same moment the silvery voice cried, in
accents of despair:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Very well, you wretch! go, if you will; but
you have disgraced Carrickmoyle, and left the
baronet without any dinner."</p>

<p>But let Sir Anthony himself explain these
extraordinary happenings, and how he met
his fate, and the strange shape in which love
came to him.</p>

<h2>THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN</h2>

<p class="center">By the Lord Bishop of Derry.</p>

<p class="center">"Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."&mdash;St. Matthew iii., 2.</p>



<div class="drop">
<img src="images/img029b.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="92" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">This proclamation, made
by the Baptist, is
the best possible beginning
for a gospel,
since men will never
repent unless they feel
that better things are
open to them.</p>
</div>

<p>Therefore, as the next chapter informs
us, these same words were the first
utterance, the modest germ, of the
profounder teaching of our Lord Himself,
and He started from the precise
point to which the forerunner had led
his followers. The next step was to fill
up somewhat these slender outlines by
saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the
kingdom of heaven is at hand: repent ye,
and believe in the gospel" (St. Matthew
iv. 17; St. Mark i. 15).</p>

<p>This announcement is necessary still.
How often have we excused our misdeeds
by the abject plea that we could not help
ourselves! It is abject, it is a confession
of slavery; but, if true, it is a perfect
defence. None may blame us for doing
what is inevitable, or failing to do what
is impossible. If a giant were to force
a torch into my hand and with it to
explode a powder magazine, I should
not be the murderer of those who
perished by my hand. I should feel outraged
and indignant, but not remorseful.</p>

<p>And whoever is really certain that he
"cannot help" his intemperance, or sloth,
or anger, need not feel remorseful any
more, but he also ought to feel outraged
and indignant. But against whom?
God? or Satan? or himself, the self of
other days? For, after all, an act which
is quite uncontrollable now may have
sprung from the wilful acts of long ago,
from compliances that forged habits
which have now become bands of steel.</p>

<p>At all events, the gospel does not deny
man's debasement and thraldom; it
asserts, not that you are naturally free,
but that you are graciously emancipated;
it is preoccupied, not with your
strength, but with the approach of reinforcements.
"The kingdom of heaven
is at hand."</p>

<p>Now think how urgently a kingdom
of heaven is required. We know to our
cost that there is an awful kingdom of
hell&mdash;an organised and systematic power
of evil. Christ Himself said it. He
declared that Satan could not cast out
Satan because evil in this world is
regulated, coherent, and organic&mdash;it is a
house, a kingdom, working consistently,
and it would fall if it were divided
against itself. And we are beset by its
forces, entangled, and made captive.
Whatever be our frailty, they seize
upon it. Am I selfish? The carelessness
of others makes me dishonest. Am
I uncharitable? Their failings provoke
my scorn. Am I light and trifling?
Their example beguiles me into excess.
Am I irascible? Their injustice lashes
me into fury. Am I sensitive? Their
neglect discourages, their harshness
ulcerates me. Am I affectionate? Their
kindness disarms my judgment and
drugs my conscience to sleep.</p>

<p>And the evil which these nurse in me
becomes in turn a snare to other men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>And all these influences are wielded
and swayed by malignant and terrible
intelligences, our foes, our tyrants.</p>

<p>Therefore we have need of a kingdom
as real, a power of goodness as systematic,
to overcome in us this organised
pressure from beneath.</p>

<p>And hence it was not mere goodness,
but a kingdom of organised and potent
goodness, which Jesus from the first
proclaimed.</p>

<p>What is the meaning of the phrase,
"the kingdom of God"&mdash;"of heaven"?
Many excellent people believe it to be
something still future, the outcome in
another dispensation of forces latent
still, the millennium, the personal reign
of Christ. And we must not deny that
there are passages which indicate that
such will be the fulness and triumphant
issue of His kingdom. But Christ did
not say, "Repent, for the kingdom of
heaven is at least nineteen centuries
away from you." And again, when
tauntingly questioned as to when this
kingdom should come, He answered that
it was come already, "not with observation,"
yet among them.</p>

<p>And, indeed, He, being Himself the
Anointed One, was always speaking of
the kingdom; so that, while the rest of
the New Testament mentions it thirty-three
times, it is mentioned in the
gospels one hundred and twenty-five
times.</p>

<p>For He spoke to men who understood
the phrase, being steeped in Old Testament
promises of the Messianic time;
and they, when their turn came, had to
preach where the mention of a new
kingdom would be as alarming as it
was to Herod.</p>

<p>If, then, our Lord had even once
employed a safer expression, this would
so much better suit His followers as
inevitably to displace among the Gentiles
His own favourite phrase, "the
kingdom." And so it comes that the
word "church," which He is only known
to have uttered on two occasions, is
found elsewhere one hundred and thirteen
times.</p>

<p>This is, indeed, an evidence of the
accuracy of the reports, for if the discourses
of our Lord were not genuine,
how could they have been marked by
this distinctive peculiarity when the
Church had become used to employ a
different word?</p>

<p>And surely it <em>is</em> the Church, this kingdom
which our Lord spoke of as a field
where tares were growing, as a little seed
which became a tree, as a net which embraced
alike good fish and bad?</p>

<p>It is the organised coherent power of
the world to come, confronting evil with
an influence and mastery superior to its
own.</p>

<p>Repent, said Christ, because the empire
of wickedness is tottering&mdash;because the
iron sceptre of the tyrant is about to
break&mdash;because the prince of this world
is soon to be cast out.</p>

<p>What do we know of the constitution,
and what of the spirit, of this divine
kingdom upon earth?</p>

<p>Jesus declared its constitution when
He said that, while the kings of this
world put forth an imperious sway, and
men obsequiously reckon them benefactors
who exercise lordship over them,
with us the conditions are reversed, and
he is greatest who stoops, helps, serves,
and forgets the ambitions that usurp and
trample.</p>

<p>What encouragement for the penitent!
In the realm which he now enters&mdash;where
he fears to be reproached for his
past rebellion&mdash;every true leader has it
for an ambition to help and serve him;
and he is made sharer in a vast and
sublime citizenship, where all, from the
Prince of Life to the lowliest true servant,
are united in desiring his victory
and joy.</p>

<p>Oh, if this is true, if the Conqueror of
Death and Hell has received gifts for us,
and ever liveth to make intercession for
us, and if, in one grand and organised
strain and stress of effort for the right,
angels and principalities and powers,
and things present and to come, and
Paul and Cephas, all are ours, then, in
the approach of such a kingdom, in the
voice that bids us rally to such a
standard of emancipation, what hope,
what animation, what an opening of
prison doors!</p>

<p>Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is
at hand.</p>

<p>With mutual help for its constitution,
now what is its aim and temper?</p>

<p>"The kingdom of God," said St. Paul,
"is not self-indulgence, not eating and
drinking, but righteousness, and peace,
and joy in the Holy Ghost."</p>

<p>It is not any <em>one</em> of these isolated from
the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Righteousness, for instance, means conformity
to rule; a sceptre of righteousness
is the same thing as a straight sceptre.</p>

<p>But can you not imagine a life of conformity
to rule, a life perfectly righteous,
being hideous?</p>

<p>Think, for instance, of a slave in a
plantation, rising early, toiling until absolute
exhaustion arrested his incessant
labours, perfectly temperate, sober, and
obedient. But all this was because the
sound of the lash was in his ears, and
the scars of it on his flesh; and all the
while his soul was either stupefied or
frenzied.</p>

<p>Well, it is not practically possible, but
it is conceivable in theory&mdash;and Christ
conceived it&mdash;that, even thus, in the fear
which has torment, one should thoroughly
obey God, remembering the pangs of
remorse, and foreboding those of hell.
And I repeat it: such a righteousness,
pressed on the reluctant soul by external
forces, would be hideous. It is the righteousness
of the prodigal's brother: "I
never transgressed.... Thou never
gavest me a kid."</p>

<p>But the kingdom of God is righteousness
combined with peace; it is obedience
to an inner law&mdash;to a law written in the
heart and mind.</p>

<p>"Righteousness, and peace, and joy."
How little of real penetrating joy comes
into an average human life! "Happy,"
says Thackeray, who knew men so well,
"happy! who is happy?" And even the
calm and tranquil Wordsworth, most
blameless of the children of his time,
complained that&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"We are pressed by heavy laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And often, glad no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We wear a face of mirth, because<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We have been glad before."<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Nor, to be frank, is the life of a
Christian altogether and perfectly joyful.
"Even we ourselves do groan within
ourselves," wrote Paul to the same
church for which he prayed that the
"God of hope would fill them with all
peace and joy."</p>

<p>But the reason he groans is because
he has only the first fruits of what is
coming. He groans waiting for the redemption
of the body, and the old
nature still has power to hinder and to
thwart him. What is new in him tends
to happiness, the higher and holier part
of him is all for joy; that is true of
him in some degree which is observed
of his Master (despite one apparent
exception by the grave of Lazarus), that
He is often said to have His soul troubled,
but only once that He rejoiced in spirit.
"The kingdom of God is righteousness,
and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."</p>

<p>This kingdom, Jesus said, was at hand.
And when His disciples were rejected,
and shook off the dust of the city from
their shoes, He bade them say, "Nevertheless,
of this be ye sure, that the
kingdom of God is come nigh unto you."</p>

<p>And it is nigh unto us to-day. It is
felt in the inmost soul even of those who
would be ashamed to confess its presence.</p>

<p>Even when you are most miserably
defeated in striving to be good, most
ashamed of failure, even when (to return
to our starting-point) you declare that
you cannot do the thing that you
would, even then you do not entirely
believe yourself; the conviction of lofty
possibilities will not quite begone;
righteousness, and peace, and joy, still
haunt your imaginings and disturb your
guilty pleasures; you feel, you know,
that these things are your heritage, and
without them you can never be content.</p>

<p>What does this strange, illogical, incessant
experience mean?</p>

<p>There is a beautiful old legend of a
Christian girl, betrayed to martyrdom by
her pagan lover in the bitterness of his
rejection, who promised as she went to
die to send him, if it were allowed to her,
some proof of her religion. On that
same wintry night, as he sat and
mourned, the legend says that a fair
boy left at his door a basket filled with
flowers of such bloom and fragrance as
never grew in earthly gardens. Whereupon
he arose and confessed Christ, and
passed through the same dusky gates of
martyrdom to rejoin her in the paradise
of God.</p>

<p>Like those flowers of unearthly growth,
proclaiming the reality of the unseen, so
do our unworldly longings, our immortal
spiritual aspirings, our feeling after a
Divine Deliverer, if haply we may find
Him, prove that the kingdom of God is
at hand.</p>

<p>Every thought of God comes from God,
and is already the operation of His Spirit.</p>

<p>Every desire for Christ is Christ's forerunner
in the soul, and bids us welcome
Christ.</p>

<p>"Repent ye, and believe the gospel."</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Homes of Noble Poverty</span></h2>

<p class="center">By the Author of "England's Youth at Worship."</p>

<p>To be miserably poor throughout life is
a burden sufficiently hard; to sink
from riches to poverty is a tragedy.
Yet it is a tragedy that we see constantly
occurring around us. To struggle with
despairing pride to preserve that outward
show which is falsely termed respectability;
to see fair-weather friends slink one by one
away; to surrender the little luxuries, innocent
enough in themselves, that have grown
to become a part of life itself&mdash;that is what
it means to slip down the hill of fortune.
"Give me neither
poverty nor riches,"
says the Book of
Proverbs, the embodiment
of wisdom for
all time.</p>

<p class="center">NOBLE POVERTY AT HAMPTON COURT.</p></div>
</div>


<p>In poverty, as in all
things else, there are
degrees. What may
be wealth to one may
be destitution to another.
It depends
upon what the previous
habits of life
have been. Take, for
instance, the gentlemen
and ladies, many
of them bearing the
noblest English names,
to whom the Queen
grants apartments in
the old Palace of
Hampton Court. They
are not without small
incomes themselves,
and the rates and
taxes they have to
pay amount to no inconsiderable
sum. Yet
to live rent free is a
boon that enables them
to live comfortably.</p>

<p>Shortly after the
commencement of his
reign George III. closed
the Palace as a royal
residence, and from
that time private
families commenced to
occupy its innumerable
rooms. These "royal
squatters," as they
have been called, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
first behaved in doubtful fashion. Many had
been granted leave to stay for a few weeks,
and quietly proceeded to make it a permanent
residence. Worse still, they seized additional
rooms when they thought they could
do so in safety, and sometimes let them
out at a substantial rent to their friends.
News of these strange doings was carried to
the king, who became very angry, as an
existing letter that he wrote shows to us.
It was proclaimed that no one would in
future be allowed to occupy a suite of
apartments save under the Lord Chamberlain's
warrant. Gradually the thousand rooms
of the great building were divided up into,
firstly, the State apartments, and, secondly,
fifty-three private suites, varying in size
from ten to forty chambers. At the present
time these suites are granted, as a general
rule, to the widows of men who have distinguished
themselves in the service of their
country. To no more worthy use could the
Palace have been placed; indeed, the tact
and discrimination which have been exhibited
by our Queen and her advisers in the distribution
of these benefits cannot be too
highly praised.</p>

<p>About the royal pensioners of Hampton
Court many interesting and amusing stories
are told. When debt brought imprisonment
as its punishment, a certain gentleman retired
to the rooms of a relation in the Palace, and
claimed the immunity of a royal residence.
The bailiffs knew that they could not arrest
him there, and hung about at the gates,
while he took his daily exercise upon the roof.
One day he incautiously ventured out and
was arrested; but he escaped from his enemies,
swam the river, and got back into safety
again. Red-tape rules supreme in the management
of the royal buildings, as the pensioners
know to their cost. Certain windows,
for instance, are never properly cleaned, owing
to the fact that the Woods and Forests
Department washes the outside of the panes
and the Lord Steward's Department the inside.
As the two departments rarely manage
to do their cleaning on the same day, the
windows are usually in a state of semi-obscurity.
To obtain the use of an old staircase
that led from her rooms to the gardens,
a lady had to successively petition the Lord
Chamberlain of Her Majesty's Household, the
Lord Steward and Board of Green Cloth,
the First Commissioner of Her Majesty's
Works, and, finally, the Woods and Forests!</p>

<p class="center">HOUSES OF THE MILITARY KNIGHTS, WINDSOR CASTLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>While chronicling the movements of the
Queen, reference is now and again made
in the daily press to the Military Knights of
Windsor. Nevertheless, but few who read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
about their doings know of what that order
consists. They are officers who have distinguished
themselves in some of our innumerable
little wars, and yet in their old age
find themselves solely dependent on a very
diminutive pension. From the Queen they
served so faithfully and well they receive
an annuity and a lodging in that vast
palace, Windsor Castle. The order is, indeed,
a pendant to that better-known home for
the veterans of the rank and file, Chelsea
Hospital. Its history is peculiarly interesting.
When that gallant warrior, King Edward
III., founded the Order of the Garter,
he ordained that each of the twenty-six companions
should be allowed to present an
"alms-knight" to the provision made for
them by the king. According to the original
grant, these veterans were to be "such as
through adverse fortune were brought to
that extremity that they had not of their
own wherewith to sustain them nor to live
so genteely as became a military condition."
That they might live "genteely" they were
given a lump sum of forty shillings a year,
and twelve pence each day they attended
the royal chapel&mdash;a small pension, it seems
to us, but it must be remembered that
money has vastly decreased in purchasing
power since those early days.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A MILITARY KNIGHT OF WINDSOR.</p></div>
</div>

<p>But evil fortune awaited the alms-knights.
They had been placed under the
supervision of the canons of St. George's
Chapel, and these priests seem to have
bullied them unmercifully. Under Edward IV.
the quarrel had grown to such a pitch that
the king interfered. Monks carried long
tales to the monarch of the insubordination
shown by the stout old warriors to
the rules that had been made for their
government. The alms-knights replied,
but in cunning they were no match for
their adversaries; "deeds not words" might
have been their motto. In the end they
were shut off from the royal bounty, and,
as an old chronicler of the times remarks,
"how they next subsisted doth not fully
appear." Bluff King Hal, however, took
pity on the poor old gentlemen that yet
remained in the land of the living, and set
apart certain lands for their maintenance.
Queen Bess added to their lodgings, but
issued a series of strict regulations as to
their behaviour, which well became the
maiden Queen, however distasteful they were
to the alms-knights themselves. Their
old enemies, the canons of St. George's
Chapel, were informed that they were to
consider themselves responsible for their behaviour,
and severe penalties awaited a
"haunter of taverns" or a "keeper of late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hours." When the Queen visited Windsor
they were to be ready to salute her; lastly,
it was ordained that no married man could
be admitted to the order, bachelors and
widowers being alone eligible.</p>

<p>Until the reign of William IV. their uniform
was more ornamental than comfortable. Indeed,
during hot weather it must have been
well-nigh intolerable, consisting as it did of
a flowing red mantle, decked with a "scutcheon
of St. George" upon the shoulder. Since the
reform instituted by that king, however, it
has consisted of a red swallow-tail coat,
dark blue trousers, cocked-hat with red and
white plume, crimson silk sash and a leather
belt for a sword. Of course, it is only on
full-dress occasions that the veterans thus
gaily bedeck themselves. Remarkably well
they then look, with their kind old faces
beaming above the rows of medals that
proclaim their past achievements. They still
mourn the discontinuance of their famous
banquet on St. George's Day; but presents
of game from the royal preserves doubtless
reconcile them to the loss of their annual
feast.</p>

<p class="center">THE HOSPICE OF ST CROSS, WINCHESTER.</p></div>
</div>

<p>From the old fortress of Windsor Castle,
fit residence for veteran soldiers, to the
quiet Hampshire country in which the Hospice
of St. Cross lies is a change indeed. So cool
and quiet does St. Cross seem that it might
be likened to some pleasant bower left by
the side of the great highway of life, along
which we jostle in the heat and dust of a
summer's day. It lies little more than a
mile from sleepy Winchester, and the River
Itchen wanders through its meadows. It
was in 1136 that Henry de Blois, the famous
bishop and statesman, founded St. Cross as
a hospital for thirteen old men. So good a
deed stood out in strong relief against the
cruelty and savagery of the times. From
north to south, from east to west, England
was desolated by all the horrors of civil war.
As the Saxon Chronicle tells us in its dying
wail, "Men openly said that Christ and His
saints slept." Yet Bishop Henry, in the
midst of his fighting and scheming, found
time to ensure comparative happiness to
thirteen poor traders whom the raiding
barons had reduced from prosperity to
poverty. Faults the great churchman may
have had in plenty; but that he had a
kind and generous heart he has left sufficient
proof behind him. No finer monument
than St. Cross could man erect to keep his
memory green.</p>

<p>On the death of its founder, St. Cross fell
into evil times. It passed under the protection
of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem,
a military order then more powerful than
scrupulous. The Jerusalem Cross which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
prominent in the church of the Hospice comes
from that source. After a long struggle the
Bishops of Winchester triumphed over the
knights, but abuses still prevailed, and the
money that should have found its way into
the pockets of the poor brethren was quietly
appropriated by fat ecclesiastics. At last,
under Henry VI., Cardinal Beaufort set to
work to remedy these evils. So noble were
his efforts that he almost deserves to be
coupled with Bishop Henry as joint-founder
of "The Hospital of Noble Poverty," as he
renamed the institution. From his time St.
Cross has never been in danger of destruction.</p>

<p>An avenue of shady trees leads to a fine
gate-house, for which St. Cross is indebted
to Cardinal Beaufort. Above the arch kneels
the effigy of the great churchman himself.
Once within the doors we almost feel as if
we had shaken off the nineteenth century
and dropped back into the days of the Tudors.
"Wayfarers' dole," a little horn mug of
beer and a slip of bread, is presented as
refreshment for the weary traveller. This
may seem strange enough to us, but there
was a time when the custom was by no
means uncommon in hospitable England.
Those were the days when wayfarers were
few, roads half-mud or half-dust, and inns
far between. Passing on, we next find ourselves
in a spacious quadrangle, having for
centre a smooth lawn of that exquisite turf
for which our country is deservedly famous.
Round it lie the chapel, hall, cloisters, and
brethren's houses. The chapel is a fine building
in the Norman style. Perhaps the most
interesting features of its interior are the
designs that adorn the walls. During the
"whitewash" period of past generations
they were covered up, but now they have
been restored to something like their original
form and colour. In this more than one of the
brethren, where they were able to do so, lent
a helping hand. The little burial ground is
to the south of the chapel. It would be
difficult to imagine a more peaceful spot for
the last resting-place of the veterans who have
fought and lost in the great battle of life.</p>

<p class="center">A VIEW OF THE CHARTERHOUSE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Have you many visitors from London
itself?" I once inquired of the gate porter of
the Charterhouse. "No, sir," said he. "We
get a lot from the country, along with the
Americans and foreigners; but precious few
Londoners ever come here." It is strange
how absolutely ignorant the average Londoner
is concerning all that is quaint and interesting
in the old buildings of the great city
in which he lives. The case of the Charterhouse
offers an excellent example. About it
the broad streams of traffic pour unceasingly
day after day; yet, though the little backwater
wherein the grey old houses lie is
but a few dozen yards away, few of the
busy crowds can either spare the time or
take the trouble to visit it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The history of the Charterhouse is a
strange one. In 1348 all London was trembling
in the grasp of the Black Death.
The grave-diggers did not know what to do
with the bodies, and finally buried them in
any pit or ditch that seemed convenient.
Famous Sir Walter Manny, the favourite
of all the fighting heroes of Froissart,
was horrified at this grave scandal. He,
together with the Bishop of London,
procured certain lands, which were consecrated
and handed over to the city that
the dead might at least receive decent
burial. It is said that fifty thousand bodies
were there interred in a few years. Some
time later, the plague abating, the same two
philanthropists commenced to build a Carthusian
monastery on part of the ground.
For three centuries the Charterhouse, under
the rigour of that stern order, pursued its
quiet path. But with Henry VIII. came evil
times for the monks. There were searching
examinations, and finality executions. The
monastery was dissolved and the building
tossed from hand to hand. Twice it was
held by Dukes of Norfolk, and for a time
was known as Norfolk House. Two of its
ducal owners passed from it to the block on
Tower Hill. Queen Elizabeth took refuge
there in the reign of Mary. There were
revels there while James I. was king, eighty
gentlemen being knighted at one time after
a banquet which had been to the royal
satisfaction. Finally it was bought by a
certain Thomas Sutton, and shortly afterwards
we find him petitioning Parliament
for licence to endow it as a home for aged
men and a school for poor children.</p>

<p>Let us take a day in the life of one of the
"old gentlemen," as the attendants always
call them. About eight o'clock a "nurse"
comes bustling into his sitting-room, lights
his fire, and sees that his breakfast is laid
ready. At nine o'clock a bell goes for chapel.
Each of the brethren must attend one chapel
a day on pain of a shilling fine stopped out
of his allowance; but he may choose the
morning or evening service as he likes.
The morning service is the more popular,
and to chapel we will now bend our steps.
It is a venerable old building, and now that
the schoolboys have left their old home and
retired to Godalming there is plenty of room.
On the right of the altar is a heavy carved
pulpit; on the left the tomb of the founder,
good Thomas Sutton, with its elaborate
carving and gold-tipped railings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">ST. KATHARINE'S HOSPITAL, REGENT'S PARK.</p></div>
</div>

<p>After chapel the old gentlemen are at
liberty to do what they like until dinner is
served at three, an hour in itself the survival<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of a custom long passed away. The hall,
with its carved woodwork, is a most interesting
spot. Wearing their gowns, the
brothers file in and take their seats at the
mahogany tables. Above the fireplace the
Sutton arms are blazoned, and from his
frame on the wall the picture of the good
merchant himself smiles down upon the
recipients of his bounty.</p>

<p>After dinner, in the summer weather, the
brothers usually chat or doze in the pleasant
shade of the buildings in the largest court.
There are few of them that have not something
out of the common about their faces,
and none of them but have a hard story
to tell, if they chose. They are of all
ranks, but mainly drawn from the classes
described in the old regulations as "poor
gentlemen, old soldiers, merchants decayed
by piracy or shipwreck, and household servants
of the sovereign." "We get a lot of
literary men here now," said an attendant,
looking knowingly at me; but I did not
pursue the conversation.</p>

<p>Evening service is at six, and at eleven the
gates are shut for the night.</p>

<p>With the institution known as St. Katharine's
Hospital the queens of England have always
been closely connected. It was founded as
long ago as 1148 by Matilda, wife of King
Stephen; but to Queen Eleanor the hospital
owed its first charter. By it the English
queens were always to be considered perpetual
patronesses, and the institution was to be
part of their dower. Eleanor added further
revenues "for the health of the soul
of her late husband and of the souls of
the preceding and succeeding kings and
queens."</p>

<p>(<em>Photo: Cassell and Co., Ltd</em>.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>Henry VIII. seems to have intended at
one time to quietly appropriate the revenues,
but Anne Boleyn, the reigning favourite,
prevented this iniquitous deed. From the
Stuarts to 1824 there is little of importance
to recount; the handful of royal pensioners
lived in comfort, and a school for poor children
was also maintained. Quiet garments
were the rule, though the strict order passed
by the queen of Edward III. against "striped
clothes" as "tending to dissoluteness" had
long been abolished. In 1824, however, came
the proposal to dig out a huge dock on the
ground whereon the hospital stood. After
great debate Parliament granted the necessary
powers. St. Katharine's Docks were begun,
and at the same time the walls of a new
St. Katharine's Hospital commenced to rise
in Regent's Park. The present buildings can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
scarcely be called beautiful, the chapel being
a poor imitation of the one at King's College,
Cambridge. The offices of master and brethren
are now practically sinecures of considerable
value presented by the Crown; a large
number of non-resident "bedesmen and bedeswomen"
are also supported out of the funds.
The Queen Victoria Jubilee Nurses' Fund
has of late years been connected with the
Hospital.</p>

<p>In the year 1847 Adelaide, Queen Dowager
of England, determined to found and endow
an asylum for widows and orphan daughters
of the officers of the Royal Navy. Penge
was the spot selected, and there twelve
pretty little houses were built and called
"King William the Fourth's Naval Asylum."
It was a graceful act of the queen, for far
too little had been previously done for the
destitute relatives of those to whom the
country owed nine-tenths of its power and
security. From its foundation the governors
and trustees have all been in some way connected
with the Navy, and can be relied
upon to appreciate the position and look
after the interests of the pensioners.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">MORDEN'S COLLEGE, BLACKHEATH.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Connected also with the sea is that old and
famous institution, Morden's College, Blackheath.
In the middle of the seventeenth
century Sir John Morden was a member
of the great Turkey Company, trading
in the Mediterranean. He had a "fair
estate," numerous ships, and all things that
in his day made up the prosperous trader.
In the City of London his name stood high.
But the tenure of riches and prosperity was
more precarious in those days than in our
own. The whole of his fleet perished on
one voyage, either by pirates or storm.
But honest Sir John did not relax his
energy because he found fortune his foe.
Steadily plodding on, he again commenced to
rise in the world, until at last, like the
patriarch Job, he was even greater and
wealthier than before. Misfortune had taught
him a lesson in charity which he never forgot.
When at the lowest depths of his calamity
he had vowed that if ever the Almighty again
crowned his efforts with success he would
provide a shelter for merchants who, like
himself, had fallen upon hard times and
lost their estates "by accidents, dangers,
and perils of the seas."</p>

<p>The College is a spacious red-brick building,
with two wings that form a central
quadrangle, which is surrounded by piazzas.
It was built according to the designs of Sir
Christopher Wren. At the present day it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
houses within its hospitable walls forty pensioners,
while one hundred out-pensioners
receive sums varying in amount up to &#163;80
per annum. The inmates, with &#163;120 each, are
very comfortably off. In 1844 a fine dining-hall
was added, in which hang the portraits
of the baronet and his lady, painted by Sir
Peter Lely. The new library was bequeathed
by the will of a son of a former inmate of
the College. With the increasing value of
property, the income of Morden's College is
now little short of &#163;18,000 a year. The
generous action of the founder well merited
the praise of an old member of the institution,
who wrote in his gratitude a poetic
effusion thus concluding:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">"What need is there of monument or bust,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With gift so noble and a cause so just?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It seeks no aid from meretricious art,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It lives enshrined in every member's heart!"<br /></span>

<p class="center">HUGGENS' COLLEGE, NORTHFLEET.</p></div>
</div>

<p>John Huggens, who founded the College at
Northfleet which bears his name, was a fine
type of the business man of the early part
of this century, a time when the commerce
of England commenced to advance by leaps
and bounds. A letter which the Rev. M. M.
Ffinch, Chaplain of the College, has kindly
lent me describes him as a tall, well-made
man in "nankeen breeches, blue dress coat,
with large gilt buttons, and a white beaver
hat with the nap fully an inch long." Like
many other founders of charitable institutions,
he had seen that the hardest poverty of all is
the poverty that will not beg and cannot,
through age, infirmity, or misfortune, make
enough to keep body and soul together. A
hard worker all his life, he would have been
the last man in the world to encourage the
sloth that comes by indiscriminate charity.
In 1847 he opened a small building of sufficient
size to house eight pensioners who had
sunk from comparative comfort into evil
times through no fault of their own. "Having
run our little bark into the smooth and
tranquil waters of the summer evening of
life," said the founder in his opening speech,
"may we sail on happily to the end of our
voyage here below!" Before and after his
death fresh houses were added, and since the
foundation of the home two hundred and
twenty-nine residents have been received
within its walls.</p>

<h2>GREAT ANNIVERSARIES</h2>

<h3><em>IN NOVEMBER.</em></h3>

<p class="center">By the Rev. A. R. Buckland, M.A., Morning Preacher at the Foundling Hospital.</p>


<p>The British
calendar
never
lacks interest.
There
is not a day
which does not
recall for us
some great
name in our
country's history,
some victory
of peace
or in war. Let
us put ourselves
in mind of a
few of these&mdash;not
necessarily
of the most
familiar or the
most striking, but of some which more
especially speak of movements and workers
in the religious and philanthropic life of the
nation.</p>

<p>November is the month in which the Long
Parliament met, and William of Orange landed
in England; it is the month of Clive's defence of
Arcot, of Hawke's battle in Quiberon Bay,
and of the soldiers' fight at Inkerman; it is the
month that saw the birth of William III., of
Laurence
Sterne and
Jonathan
Swift, of Sir
Matthew Hale,
of Richard
Baxter, of William
Cowper,
William Hogarth,
Henry
Havelock, John
Bright, and
Frederick
Temple; it is
the month in
which Adam
Smith published
his
"Wealth of
Nations," and
Charles Darwin his "Origin of Species"; it
is the month in which Cardinal Wolsey, John
Milton, and Admiral Benbow died; it is the
month which saw the State pageant many this
year have called to mind, the funeral of the
Duke of Wellington.</p>

<p>Sir Matthew Hale (born November 1st, 1609)
is but one of the many judges who have
joined to eminence in the law the example
of a devout mind and a life of religious zeal.
He administered
justice
in the times
both of the
Commonwealth
and of
the Restoration.
Stillingfleet
and
Baxter were
amongst his
friends, and
his life of
austerity witnessed
to his
consistent
sympathy with
Puritan ideals.
Before him
there came
John Bunyan, for the then heinous crime
of frequenting conventicles. He wrote with
equal facility upon law, morals, and theology,
and his MSS. are still amongst the treasures
of Lincoln's Inn.</p>

<p>Richard Baxter (born November 12th, 1615)
had a career of singular variety. Sometimes
thought of only as a pioneer of Nonconformity
and the author of the "Saint's Everlasting
Rest," he shared in the startling changes of
his period. He had tried in early years a
courtier's life; he received holy orders from
the Bishop of Worcester; he was for a time
a chaplain to the Parliamentary forces; he
was on Cromwell's Committee to "settle the
fundamentals of religion"; he was, a few
years after, a chaplain-in-ordinary to King
Charles II.; he might have been Bishop of
Hereford; and he lived to be tried for sedition
before Judge Jeffreys. He is known to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
many, who are not familiar with his other
works, by the hymn "Lord, it belongs not
to my care." Curiously enough, this hymn is
said to have been repeated, during his last
illness, by the late distinguished physicist,
Professor James Clerk Maxwell,
who also is a November
worthy, born on the 13th of
this month.</p>

<p>Dean Swift (born November
30th, 1667) had little of the
divine about him, though he
obtained an Irish deanery
and aspired to an English
bishopric. Politician and
satirist, some of his books
are still eagerly read by
those who have forgotten the
circumstances which produced
them, as well as the defects
which stained his character.
William Cowper (born November
15th, 1731) is a pleasanter
memory. The Christian
Church is not likely soon to
forget the "Olney Hymns"
and their authors, although
Cowper's descriptive poetry and his letters are
less familiar than they might be. And "John
Gilpin"&mdash;can he ever be forgotten? With
these authors we may reasonably join a moralist
who taught by another art. William
Hogarth (born November 10th, 1697) reproached
the vices of a licentious age with a
power of pictorial satire which has never been
excelled. He was one of the group of distinguished
artists
who associated
themselves with
the early history
of the Foundling
Hospital.</p>

</div>

<p>Of Christian
soldiers, who has
appealed to us
more strongly
than Henry
Havelock (died
November 24th,
1857)? "So
long," it has
been truly said,
"as the memory
of great deeds,
and high courage,
and spotless
self-devotion is
cherished among
his countrymen, so long will Havelock's lonely
grave beneath the scorching Eastern sky, hard
by the vast city, the scene alike of his toil,
his triumph, and his death, be regarded as
one of the most holy of the countless spots
where Britain's patriot soldiers lie." As with
many another man, his religious character
owed much to the influence of his wife, a
daughter of that Marshman whose name
will always be remembered in the history
of Indian missions. To Outram
the dying man could
say, "I have for forty years
so ruled my life that when
death came I might face it
without fear." "Principles
alone," wrote Havelock, "are
worth living for or striving
for." The words might stand
as a motto for the life of
John Bright (born November
16th, 1811), Christian statesman
and orator, one of the
many members of the Society
of Friends who have left
their names writ large in
their country's history. The
men who remember the
struggle for Free Trade are
passing away, but the part
played by John Bright is
not likely soon to be forgotten.</p>

<p>November has not been a month fruitful
in the foundation of philanthropic and
religious organisations. But to those who
have watched the progress of the temperance
movement in England, who remember the
difficulties of its pioneers, and the obloquy
which often fell upon them, November has
a claim as the birth-month of one of the
earliest and hardest of the temperance
workers&mdash;Frederick
Temple,
Archbishop of
Canterbury.
Born in the
Ionian Isles on
November 30th,
1821, he has, all
through his manhood
been a
vigorous exponent
of the
total abstinence
cause. From the
first he recognised
no bounds
of denomination
in its support,
and although he
has been a great
power to the
Church of England
Temperance Society, he has always lent
his voice and influence to other agencies
working in the same great cause. He has
an invaluable helper in his wife, in both temperance
and diocesan work.</p>

<h2>HOW BARNFORD CHURCH WAS SAVED.</h2>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">A Complete Story.</span></p>

<p class="center">By Scott Graham, Author of "Pemberton's Piece,"
"All Through Prejudice," Etc.</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/img042b.jpg" alt="W" width="100" height="177" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">When Llewellyn
Percival, the
new Rector,
first beheld the
dilapidated pile
called by courtesy
Barnford
Church, his
heart sank. The
late Rector, who
had just died,
aged ninety,
had held the
living fifty
years, and during
his sway
scarcely any
repairs had
been done. The
parish, a remote village in the East of
England, was an exceedingly poor one;
and the very ancient and interesting
church had literally settled down&mdash;for
one side was much out of the perpendicular&mdash;to
decay.</p>
</div>

<p>It smelt incredibly fusty, it was disfigured
by hideous high pews, daubed
with yellow paint, locally termed "horse-boxes";
the fine west window was blocked
by a huge gallery containing the organ&mdash;an
instrument so much out of order that
half the notes were mute, and the pipes
emitted the weirdest groans, absolutely
terrifying to a stranger. The old sexton
assured Llewellyn that the roof was
so leaky that in wet weather the rain
poured down on the congregation, and
though there was a stove, it was so ill-constructed
that in winter the cold was
terrible. There was a fine old peal of
bells, but the tower at the west end
had a huge crack running from top to
bottom, and seemed so unsafe that they
did not dare to ring more than one.</p>

<p>All this was sadly disheartening; especially
as the church was really a fine building,
with a splendid Norman doorway,
a dilapidated but still beautiful carved
screen, and many interesting features.</p>

<p>"Is there really no rich family in the
place who could help to restore it?"
Llewellyn asked the sexton. "What
about the people at the fine grey-stone
Manor House, there among the trees?"</p>

<p>"Oh, them's the Lancasters&mdash;they're
rich enough, but you'll not get nothing
out o' them, sir. Old Squire Lancaster
and the old Rector quarrelled years ago
about the family pew, and ever since
they've gone to Thornton Church, in the
next village. Miss never gives nothing
to this church now."</p>

<p>"Is she an elderly lady?"</p>

<p>"Bless you, no sir, she's quite young&mdash;twenty-four,
maybe&mdash;and handsome too.
She's the only child, and since th' old
Squire died she's had it all her own
way, for her ma's a great invaleed, and
never troubles about anything."</p>

<p>Llewellyn sighed. It did seem unfortunate
that the only rich people in
the place should have quarrelled with
the late incumbent. He asked an old
friend, an architect, to come and stay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
with him in the comfortable Rectory,
which was such a contrast to the tumbledown
church, and give his opinion about
the restoration.</p>

<p>After due examination, Mr. Lane announced
that, unless the foundations
were strengthened, the tower at least
partially rebuilt, the roof renewed, and
the walls mended in weak places, the
church could not last much longer. This
would cost at least two thousand pounds,
and if a new organ, new pews, and
some much-needed internal improvements
were also effected, a thousand more
would be necessary. Poor Llewellyn&mdash;he
was only thirty, and this was his first
church&mdash;groaned aloud, as well he might.
He had only a hundred a year of his
own, besides his sorely depreciated living:
and the small farmers and labourers who
populated the parish were powerless to
help. He might appeal to the Bishop,
but the diocese was a very large and
poor one, and Barnford was only one
among many churches urgently needing
repairs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/img043.jpg" width="350" height="431" alt="rich" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Is there no rich family in the place who could help to
restore it?"&mdash;<em>p. 37.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>"If you can find the money, I'll undertake
the work without fees, for absolutely
out-of-pocket expenses," said Lane
generously. "I'd do it economically too,
and save you as much as possible."</p>

<p>Llewellyn thanked him most heartily,
but, nevertheless, the thought of that two
thousand pounds weighed upon him like
a nightmare. He soon made the acquaintance
of the formidable Miss Lancaster
at a neighbouring Vicarage. The family
were descended from a wealthy banker
who had bought Barnford Manor for a
country house, and as sole heiress Laura
had nearly five thousand
a year and was a great
catch. She was a tall,
dark, handsome girl, with
a commanding air due to
the fact that from her
childhood she had been
flattered and petted by
everybody. But she was
civil to Llewellyn and invited
him to call at the
Manor; apologising for
her mother as an invalid
who never went anywhere.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lancaster did not
appear when Llewellyn
went, but Laura, who had
been her own chaperon
all her life, entertained
him in the handsome
drawing-room with great
composure. He had never
seen a girl with such an
assured manner before.</p>

<p>Over his cup of tea he
ventured, humbly and
meekly, to hint at the
restoration of the church.</p>

<p>"It's such a picturesque
old place that it would
be a shame to pull it to
pieces and spoil it by
injudicious restoration,"
returned Laura decidedly.</p>

<p>"It isn't a question of
my own particular fads,
Miss Lancaster, but the
fabric is absolutely unsafe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
owing to an extensive settlement. The
roof isn't watertight, and the windows
are almost tumbling out of the walls."</p>

<p>"And how much would be needed?"</p>

<p>"A friend of mine, an architect, has
most kindly offered to give his services
without fees; but to make the place
even decent would cost, he says, two
thousand pounds."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img044.jpg" width="450" height="300" alt="clergymen" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"You clergymen are all alike!" she cried.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"You will never raise such a sum here!"
was her brusque answer.</p>

<p>"I don't like to commence our acquaintance
by begging, Miss Lancaster; but
if you could see your way to do anything
for what is, after all, your parish
church&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, but we always go to Thornton.
Old Mr. Short was awfully rude to father
years ago, and we left the church. I play
the organ at Thornton and train the choir;
and the Vicar and his wife are great
friends of ours. I couldn't leave them
in the lurch by coming back to this church
now&mdash;especially as Thornton is a very
poor parish too."</p>

<p>"Even if you don't attend the services,
I should be most thankful for any offer
of help towards the restoration," he
patiently answered, determined not to
show annoyance at her abruptness.
"Something must be done, and very
soon."</p>

<p>The heiress tapped her foot petulantly
on the carpet.</p>

<p>"You clergymen are all alike!" she
cried. "You undertake tasks too great
for you, and then come to the laity for
help! A poor parish like this could never
raise two thousand pounds, unless we
ourselves gave the whole sum, which we
certainly can't afford to do. There is
nobody else here to subscribe."</p>

<p>"Believe me, I never thought of asking
you for such a large sum as two thousand
pounds, or even a quarter of it, Miss
Lancaster. But the smallest sum would
be welcome, as the nucleus of a fund.
I intend to use my uttermost efforts to
raise the money, if it takes me the rest
of my life!"</p>

<p>His fair, good-humoured, and thoroughly
English face had assumed a very dogged
look as he uttered the last words: and
Laura, who knew a real man when she
saw him, noted it approvingly. In her
secret heart she relished a little wholesome
opposition; it was an agreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
novelty when most people were so subservient.</p>

<p>"But how can you raise it?" she asked
doubtingly.</p>

<p>"This is now October, and these country
villages are so dull in the winter evenings
that any entertainment is welcome. If
the Bishop will consent, I propose to get
a very good magic-lantern, with several
sets of slides, and exhibit it in the villages
and small towns round, with the consent
of their clergy, and paying a certain
proportion of the proceeds to their own
charities if they lend me a hall. I shall
charge very little for seats, from a shilling
down to twopence or threepence; and
as I shall explain the views and work
the apparatus myself, the expenses will
be nothing."</p>

<p>"Fancy the Rector of Barnford turning
showman! What a come-down!" said
disdainful Laura. "I can't think you
will make much! However, if you
succeed, and come to me in the spring
with a statement of the profits, I promise
I will give you as much as they
amount to."</p>

<p>It was more than he expected; and he
thanked her warmly, despite her evident
conviction that the profits would be small.</p>

<p>"I'll give you a written promise, if
you like, to that effect," added Miss
Lancaster, who was a most businesslike
young woman.</p>

<p>"No, thank you; a lady's word is quite
enough," he answered earnestly; and
a genial smile stole over her handsome
face as he spoke, for she was secretly
pleased by his chivalrous trust.</p>

<p>On the whole, he quitted the Manor
fairly well satisfied; for though Laura
could not be described, by any stretch of
courtesy, as an amiable girl, he discerned
fine traits of character behind her somewhat
repellent manner. "A girl who
wants knowing," he decided. "She has
been flattered because of her riches, and
pestered by mercenary suitors, until she
imagines all men are deceivers!"</p>


<p class="center">II.</p>

<p>The Bishop, who was a liberal-minded
man, and much interested
in the restoration of the church,
entirely approved of the projected
lantern entertainment. In addition,
a drawing-room meeting was
held at the Palace, which produced
twenty-five pounds, and the Bishop added
another twenty. As Llewellyn had
decided to set apart his own hundred
pounds annually until the restoration
was completed, he felt justified in immediately
commencing the most necessary
repairs at once, trusting that the
printed appeals which the Bishop caused
to be sent out would bring in a steady
flow of subscriptions.</p>

<p>He inaugurated his magic-lantern entertainment
at Barnford itself with great
success, for the Bishop came over with
several friends, and Mrs. Lancaster sent
a sovereign for five tickets. But neither
she nor her daughter put in an appearance,
their places being filled by their servants.
The principal farmer lent his biggest
barn gratis, so that Llewellyn cleared over
five pounds that night. And after that,
though he encountered some good-natured
ridicule, the Rector and his lantern were
in great request. His enterprise was even
commended in the London papers; and
the villagers simply crowded to the
entertainment everywhere, glad of some
amusement in the long winter evenings.
The richer farmers and tradespeople
gladly paid a shilling or eighteenpence for
a seat, and the smaller sums mounted up
amazingly, so that, after all deductions,
Llewellyn seldom received less than between
two and three pounds for one
evening. Although he never gave
more than four exhibitions a week,
being resolute not to neglect his own
parish, he made over forty pounds a
month.</p>

<p>Little could be done to the church before
spring, as it proved a very severe winter,
and outdoor work was impeded by frost.
Tarpaulins were temporarily stretched
over the cracked roof, but at best it was
a very shivery and dreary spot, so that
Llewellyn always returned with renewed
eagerness to his magic-lantern journeys
after a Sunday spent in the desolate
building, where the howls of the ruined
organ made the singing a mockery. In
his private life he exercised the strictest
self-denial, for the scanty income from
his living left no margin for luxuries. He
scarcely went into any society, as his
engagements left him no time; for, as
Miss Lancaster informed everybody, he
was a perfect maniac on the subject of
restoring the church. He met her now
and then in going about the roads; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
sometimes she passed him with a brief
nod, though occasionally she would stop
to ask, with some mockery in her tones,
how the magic-lantern was getting on.
She never appeared at his
church, though it was so
much nearer than Thornton,
and the duty-calls he paid
at the Manor were few and
brief.</p>

<p>In February the long frost
broke up, whereupon Mr.
Lane arrived one Saturday
night at the Rectory with a
view to commencing work
in earnest. After the Sunday
morning service Llewellyn
felt impelled to rebuke
the old sexton, who was supposed
to clean the church.
"When did you dust the
pews last, Reed? The very
air seems choked with it;
the reading-desk and my
books and the communion
rails are in a disgraceful
state!"</p>

<p>The old man began the
rigmarole he always employed
when criticised. "I
served Mr. Short, man and
boy, for fifty years, and
never was told the church
was dirty afore! I cleaned
it out reg'lar, on Saturday,
I did, and dusted everything,
sir!"</p>

<p>The Rector shrugged his
shoulders as he looked round
at the dust which he could
see lying thick on every
moulding and ledge, but said
no more to Reed. On reaching
home, however, he mentioned
the matter to his
friend Lane, who had not
been at church, having caught a bad
cold on the journey. To his intense
amazement, no sooner had he mentioned
the amount of dust in the church than
Lane started up, and, disregarding all
remonstrances, flung on his overcoat and
hat, and started off through the churchyard
at a tremendous pace to examine
the tower from outside. Although carefully
shored up in the autumn, the crack
in it had widened perceptibly even to
Llewellyn's sight, and was extending
across the wall of the south aisle.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">She hastened to the churchyard.&mdash;<em>p. 42.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>"It's the frost," said the architect ruefully,
after a thorough examination both
inside and out. "It has assisted in disintegrating
the masonry, and caused a
further settlement that may bring the
old tower down with a run any minute.
Being Sunday, we can't do anything to
prevent it, even if that were possible now.
The dust in the church is no fault of old
Reed, but is simply caused by the stones
of the tower grinding together, because
every moment they are becoming more displaced.
To-morrow, if it stands till then,
I'll try and get men to take it down."</p>

<p>Poor Llewellyn looked very dejected.
"Oh, Lane, this is bad news! If the tower
falls, it will wreck half the church!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a pity, certainly, but it's nobody's
fault. You mustn't have service in it
again, for it really isn't safe."</p>

<p>Fortunately, during the dark winter
months Llewellyn, at the urgent request
of the inhabitants at the other end of his
very large and straggling parish, was
accustomed to hold service on alternate
Sunday evenings in a large room at the
outskirts of the village, and was due there
that night. He decided not to say anything
about the tower, for fear of alarming
his parishioners; but he carefully
locked the churchyard gate so that no
one could enter it, and, returning home,
he took the key of the church from the
nail where it usually hung, telling his old
servant Dorcas that nobody must go into
the church on any pretext whatsoever,
as he feared it was unsafe.</p>

<p>That afternoon he called to soothe old
Reed's wounded feelings by saying in
confidence what had caused the dust.
He strictly enjoined the sexton in case
any strangers came to inspect the church,
as they did sometimes, not to admit them
on any account. Reed promised faithfully;
but that Sunday was a sadly anxious
time for Llewellyn, who expected
every moment to hear a mighty crash
and see the tower fall.</p>

<p>Early next day Lane set off to engage
men and appliances; for the old tower,
to his great surprise, was still standing,
though perceptibly more out of the perpendicular.
Llewellyn departed to the
school, and had not been gone long,
when an imperative knock sounded at
the Rectory door. Dorcas opened it to
behold Miss Lancaster and another girl,
Daisy Staples, an old schoolfellow, who
was staying at the Manor.</p>

<p>"I've come to borrow the key of the
church, please. I want my friend to see
it, and I'll bring back the key when
we've done with it." Laura, it is needless
to say, had heard no whisper of the precarious
state of the tower.</p>

<p>Dorcas, who, like all the villagers, stood
considerably in awe of Miss Lancaster,
was much taken aback. "I'm very sorry,
miss," stammered she, "but you mustn't
go into the church&mdash;master says it's not
safe; and I wasn't to give the key to
anybody."</p>

<p>"Not safe!" cried Laura incredulously.
She had seen the old place shored up
with timber so long that the spectacle had
lost all its significance. "What nonsense!
I'm sure it's just as safe as it ever
was, and I particularly want my friend
to see it. So give me the key, please,
and we'll go."</p>

<p>"I haven't got it, miss, indeed. Master
took it away, and left word nobody was
to go inside."</p>

<p>The spoilt heiress, unaccustomed to
opposition, turned upon her heel in high
dudgeon. "Then I can only say your
master is a most arbitrary and disagreeable
man!" she cried angrily. "Mr.
Percival is just like all the rest of the
clergy, Daisy!" she grumbled to her
friend as they went away. "They love
to show their power by tyrannising over
the laity! I don't believe the church is
really unsafe at all! Probably the Rector
thinks that because I won't go to his
services on Sundays I don't deserve to
enter the church on weekdays, and so I
am to be refused the key!"</p>

<p>Angry people are very seldom dignified;
and Laura, knowing that Daisy was
keenly interested in architecture, was
determined to try and accomplish her
project somehow. "After all, I'm a
parishioner, and I've a <em>right</em> to enter the
church!" she exclaimed. "The old sexton
has a key, and we'll go and get his, since
that cross woman refused the Rector's."</p>

<p>But the sexton was out. As no answer
was returned to her knocks, Laura, who
was well acquainted with his habits,
tried the door, which was unfastened,
and, looking in, saw the large church key
hanging on its accustomed nail in his
little kitchen. She snatched at it in
triumph, and hastened to the churchyard;
only to find her progress once more
barred.</p>

<p>"Mr. Percival has actually gone and
locked the gate!" she exclaimed, descending
to slipshod English in her excitement.
"Now, I should say that must be distinctly
illegal! At any rate, here goes!"</p>

<p>They vaulted over, with the agility of
modern girls practised in gymnastics, and
very soon were inside the church. The
dust was thicker than ever, but in the
excitement of displaying the various
points of interest Laura hardly noticed
it; and they poked about everywhere,
little dreaming of the appalling risk
they ran.</p>

<p>Llewellyn, on quitting the school, came
round to speak to Reed; and found the
old man, who had just returned, standing
staring stupidly at the bare nail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
on the wall. "Did you come and fetch
the church key away, sir?" he began.</p>

<p>"I? I've never touched it&mdash;never seen
it! And yet it's gone from the nail!
Surely it can't be that somebody has
taken it to go inside the church! Lane
says the tower can't possibly last out
the day."</p>

<p>For an instant they gazed at each
other with scared faces; and then
Llewellyn rushed away, mad with fear,
clearing first the churchyard fence, and
then the tombstones with incredible
bounds. As he went a curious, dull
rumble was audible, and to his horror
he distinctly saw the massive tower
first sway slightly, and then commence
to slip, slip with a horrible motion
unlike anything he had ever seen before.
The church door was ajar&mdash;there must
be somebody inside! Pray Heaven he
might be in time!</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img048.jpg" width="450" height="416" alt="rest" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"I couldn't rest till I saw you," she faltered.&mdash;<em>p. 44.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Meanwhile the girls, poring over an
old floor-brass, were startled by the
rumbling; whilst the dust grew so
much thicker that Laura exclaimed,
"Pah! What a stuffy old place! That
rumble must be thunder&mdash;there it is
again!"</p>

<p>Still not suspecting their danger, they
leisurely retraced their steps to the
south door, at the bottom of the church,
very near the fatal tower. Laura could
distinctly remember turning past the last
pew; but after that nothing was clear.
She only knew that some man, unrecognisable
in the cloud of dust and mortar
which suddenly obscured everything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
threw himself, as a still louder rumble
occurred, with what then seemed absolutely
brutal violence upon her and
Daisy. Seizing her with a force which
for days left bruises on her arms, he
positively hurled her and her friend
before him through the open door.
Then before he had himself quite crossed
the threshold the entire fabric of the
tower fell with a terrific crash, wrecking
the whole of that end of the church.</p>


<p class="center">III.</p>

<p>When Llewellyn Percival, after
some time, recovered from the
effects of a serious wound on
his head from a falling stone,
and a broken arm, it was to find himself
a popular hero. To his own mind,
he had only done a most ordinary
thing, such as any man would naturally
do; and he could not understand why
all the papers should publish glowing
accounts of his bravery. The poor old
sexton, who had faithfully followed him
on his errand of mercy, and had only
been deterred by his age and feebleness
from arriving in time, deserved quite as
many thanks as he did, Llewellyn maintained.
But the fickle public did not
think so, and subscriptions for Barnford
Church literally poured in.</p>

<p>It is a fine thing to be a popular idol,
even for a day; and Llewellyn received
so much kindness during his illness that
he had never been happier in his life.
An old aunt came to nurse him; and
on the first day he was allowed to
come downstairs a humble message was
brought that Miss Lancaster would like
to see him for a moment, if it would
not tire him too much. She and her
mother had been incessant in their
inquiries, besides sending fruit, flowers,
and invalid delicacies daily.</p>

<p>"Show her in," said Llewellyn, unheeding
his aunt's remonstrance; and in a
minute she was bending over the chair
from which he feebly strove to rise,
her dark eyes full of tears. "I couldn't
rest till I saw you," she faltered. "But
oh! if you had been killed, I should
have felt like a murderess! It was all
my fault, for being so obstinate and
wicked! When Dorcas told me I couldn't
have the key of the church, I thought"&mdash;and
she hung her head&mdash;"I said, indeed,
that it was a piece of spiteful tyranny
on your part, just to assert your arbitrary
authority. Oh, how could I ever
think it of you? Say you forgive me&mdash;only
say so!"</p>

<p>With the tears of genuine repentance
and humility streaming down her face,
it was not possible for mortal man to refuse
her anything. "My dear Miss Lancaster,
pray don't distress yourself!
We are all liable to errors of judgment,
and, believe me, I forgive you from my
heart&mdash;if, indeed, I have anything to
forgive."</p>

<p>"Besides that, I've always been horrid
to you," she sighed remorsefully. "I
wouldn't help about the restoration, nor
do anything in the parish, and I sneered
at your magic-lantern. Oh, yes, I did&mdash;you
can't deny it. But I hope now you
won't worry any more about raising
funds. Daisy and I, as a thank-offering
for the great mercy vouchsafed to us,
are going to finish the restoration, if
you'll only tell us what you'd like.
No, not a word of thanks&mdash;at least,
not to <em>me</em>&mdash;I feel I really don't deserve
it."</p>

<p>And the dignified, self-complacent Miss
Lancaster fairly bolted from the room;
conscious that her face was quite unfit
to be seen, and that it was absolutely
necessary to have her cry out somewhere.
Llewellyn leaned back in his
chair, almost overwhelmed by the knowledge
that he was about to attain his
heart's desire at last.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The restored Barnford Church was
such a dream of beauty that sometimes
Llewellyn would ask himself whether it
were a real building or only a fairy
vision. The light fell through beautiful
painted windows; an excellent organ
replaced the old one; and oak pews, exquisitely
carved, filled the nave. A huge
gilt cock strutted proudly above the
restored tower, and a brass tablet near
the pulpit declared the restoration to be
the thank-offering of two grateful hearts.
People came from far and near to the
services, eager to see the beautiful church,
but the largest crowd that ever assembled
in the building came on the
occasion of the marriage of the Rector
to Laura Lancaster.</p>

<h2>AS CHAPLAIN
TO MR SPEAKER</h2>

<p class="center">Some Reminiscences
of Parliament.</p>

<p class="center">By F. W. Farrar, D.D.,
Dean of Canterbury.</p>


<p>I knew
something
about the
Houses of
Legislature, and
had been present
at not a
few debates,
long before I
had the high
honour of being
a Chaplain to
the Speaker.
Many years
ago, when I
was a master
at Harrow, I
had the privilege
of knowing
the late Lord Charles Russell,
whose son, Mr. G. W. E. Russell, was
once in my form, and who always
treated me with conspicuous kindness.
Lord Charles was for a long time
the highly popular Serjeant-at-Arms of
the House of Commons. There are only
two persons who enjoy the privilege of
having "private galleries" at their
disposal at the end of the House&mdash;the
Speaker and the Serjeant-at-Arms.
Whenever there was likely to be a very
important debate, which excited keen
public interest, Lord Charles used to
offer us two seats in his gallery. I
availed myself of this exceptional privilege
as often as I could, and in that way
I have been present at some of those
deeply interesting political and oratorical
displays which may almost be said to
have become things of the past. The
speaking of the most distinguished leaders
in the House of Commons is still manly,
forcible, and lucid: but I do not think
that I am only speaking as a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">laudator
temporis acti, Me puero</i>, when I say
that never&mdash;or, at any rate, only on the
rarest occasions&mdash;do we now hear those
flashing interchanges of wit, or those
utterances of sustained, impassioned, and
lofty eloquence which were by no means
unfrequent thirty years ago. It may be
that the pressure of affairs is greater,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
owing to the immense and ever-extending
interests of the British Empire; or
that there is not, at the present moment,
the intense political excitement which
once prevailed; or that the prevalent
taste in such matters is different:&mdash;but,
whatever be the reason, it would, I
think, be generally admitted that, in
nine cases out of ten, debates in these
days are more unexciting and more
severely practical than once they were,
so that speeches full of "thoughts that
breathe and words that burn" are now
rarely delivered before our assembled
senators. For that reason the debates
are far less interesting and memorable
than they were in former times.</p>

<p>There are still many speakers in the
House to whom all must listen with
pleasure and admiration. Sir W. Harcourt,
Sir Henry Fowler, Mr. Morley,
Mr. Goschen, Mr. Balfour, always set
forth their arguments with force and
dignity; and it would, I think, be
generally conceded that few speakers
could surpass Mr. Chamberlain in the
skill and fearless forthrightness with
which he enunciates his views. There
are still a few debaters who might bear
comparison with Sir Robert Peel in the
dignified enunciation of views full of
sober wisdom; or with Mr. Cobden in his
"unadorned eloquence"; or with Lord
Palmerston in his unstudied and lively
geniality:&mdash;but since first Mr. Bright, and
then Mr. Gladstone, stepped out of the
political arena, anyone who could be
called "a great orator" has become very
uncommon in Parliamentary debates.
No orator in the House has acquired, or
perhaps even aims at, the fame for
eloquence obtained in the political arena
by men like O'Connell, Sheil, Lord
Macaulay, Sir Edward Bulwer, Mr.
Disraeli, John Bright, Lord Sherbrooke
when he was at his best, or William
Ewart Gladstone. We do not now
have speeches which, like that of
Lord Brougham in the House of Lords
on the Reform Bill, occupied six hours
in the delivery; or, like the famous
"<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Civis Romanus sum</i>" speech of Lord
Palmerston in the Don Pacifico debate,
are prolonged "from the dusk of a summer
evening to the dawn of a summer
day."</p>

<p>This may partly be due to the fact
that we have not, for many years, passed
through political crises in which the hearts
of men have been so powerfully stirred
as they were in the times of the first
Reform Bill; or in the early struggles
of the Irish party; or in the debates on
the abolition of the corn laws; or during
the thrilling incidents of the Crimean
War. In these days speeches are shorter,
less formal, less ornate, less impassioned.
But if the passions of men should again
be stirred as they were by those anxious
issues, doubtless the same stormy eloquence
might once more be evoked. In
those days the hearts of millions beat
like the heart of one man. One or two
historic incidents may serve to illustrate
the intensity of national feeling.</p>

<p>While the great issues at stake in
the first Reform Bill were filling the
thoughts of all, only one Bishop, Dr.
Philpotts of Exeter, voted (I believe)
in favour of the Bill. The consequence
was that the whole bench of Bishops
was for a time overwhelmed with
national hatred. The late genial and
kind-hearted Duke of Buccleuch told me
that he had been severely hurt in an
attempt to protect the Bishops from
popular insult as they came out of the
House of Lords. The Bishops had to
sign a common protest that they
were no longer able to carry out their
legislative duties because they could not
attend the House of Lords with safety.
Even in Canterbury, when the kindly
Archbishop Howley visited his metro-political
city, he was assaulted by the mob
in the streets, pelted with mud and dead
cats, prevented from dining at the Guildhall,
and was only saved by two or three
courageous gentlemen from being dragged
out of his carriage and brutally ill-treated.
Lord Macaulay's celebrated description
of the scene which took place in the House
of Commons when the Bill was passed
by a very small majority proves how
much less inflammable is the present
state of the political atmosphere.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>He tells us that not only did the
members who attached supreme importance
to the passing of the Bill clasp
each other by the hand
with tears, but that,
with unprecedented disregard
of the decorous
traditions of Parliament,
they leapt upon the
benches, and stood there
waving their hats, and
cheering themselves
hoarse.</p>

<p>Take again the scene
which the House witnessed
during a memorably
eloquent speech of
Mr. Bright. He was addressing
a House which
in those days all but
unanimously rejected his
opinions, though time
has since then shown
how well deserving they
were of consideration;
and yet he moved many
to tears who were little accustomed to
give open signs of their emotion. He
always spoke in a style of nervous
Saxon English, and his words on that
occasion were a singular mixture of unconventional
homeliness and profound
pathos.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="center">JOHN BRIGHT SPEAKING IN THE HOUSE
OF COMMONS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>He mentioned that he had met Colonel
Boyle, a well-known member of the
House&mdash;"at Mr. Westerton's, the bookseller's
I think it was, at the corner of
Hyde Park"&mdash;and had asked him whether
he was going out to the Crimea. He
answered that he was afraid he was.
"It was not fear for himself; he knew
not that. 'But,' he said, 'to go out to the
war is a serious thing for a man who has
a wife and five children.' The stormy
Euxine is his grave; his wife is a widow;
his children are fatherless." And then,
after alluding to other well-known members
who had perished in the Crimean
War, he added, "The Angel of Death
has been among us; we may almost hear
the beating of his wings."</p>

<p>As he spoke many of the assembled
gentlemen of England were seen indignantly
dashing away, or furtively wiping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
from their eyes, the tears of which no
one need have been for one moment
ashamed. When Lord Palmerston arose
to answer the oration, and to repeat to
the House its own predominant convictions,
the bursts of cheering with which
his entirely unoratorical speech was
welcomed were heard even in the
House of Lords. But what the
members cheered was not Lord
Palmerston's eloquence, for to eloquence
he had scarcely the smallest
pretence, but the British pluck
which would not succumb to the
intense feeling which the great
orator had aroused by appeals that
had held his audience "hushed as an
infant at the mother's breast."</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center">A CHARACTERISTIC ATTITUDE OF THE LATE MR. GLADSTONE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On the evening before this speech Mr.
Bright and Mr. Cobden had been the
guests of a former kind friend of
mine, Mr. W. S. Lindsay, M.P., in his
beautiful house on the banks of the
Thames. Mr. Lindsay had been the warm
ally of both these great leaders in the
Free Trade agitation, and he told me
this curious anecdote. Mr. Bright, as is
well known, carefully studied his speeches
and committed them to memory word
for word, delivering them in such
measured, yet often thrilling, tones as
gave to each word its utmost force.
Mr. Lindsay said that the evening
before&mdash;knowing the extreme importance
of the speech, and the fact that he
would be trying to persuade a multitude
of hearers against their will&mdash;Mr. Bright
had recited to these two friends in the
drawing-room the arguments which he
intended to enunciate. But he had not
then brought in the allusion to the
Angel of Death. The three members
were sitting side by side during the
debate; and it was perhaps as a relief
to his own over-burdened feelings that
Mr. Cobden, when the tumult of applause
which followed the speech had
subsided, said to Mr. Bright, "Where
did you get hold of that passage about
the angel, John? You did not say it
to us last night." "No," answered the
orator; "I only thought of it while I
was dressing this morning." "Now, if
you had said 'the <em>flapping</em> of his wings,'
instead of 'the <em>beating</em> of his wings,'"
said Cobden, "everyone would have
laughed." I have no doubt that in this
apparently trivial criticism Cobden was
only seeking to lighten the oppression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of his own misgivings about the
national policy of that time; but,
curiously enough, I several times
heard Dean Stanley allude to the great
speech, both in conversation and in
sermons, and he <em>always</em> quoted the
passage, "We may almost hear the
<em>flapping</em> of his wings."</p>

<p class="center">RICHARD COBDEN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Several of Mr. Bright's best points
seem to have occurred to him suddenly.
In the days when there was the secession
from the Liberal party to which he
gave the popular nickname of "the
Cave of Adullam," speaking of the fact
that the members of the party seemed
to be all on an equality, and to have
no acknowledged leader, he convulsed
the House with laughter by comparing
them to one of those shaggy lapdogs of
which it was difficult to distinguish
which was the head and which was the
tail. One leading member of this party
was the late Mr. Horsman&mdash;a very
forcible debater, who used sometimes to
be spoken of as "the wild Horsman."
I once heard a little passage of arms
between him and the late Lord Houghton.
"Ah!" said Mr. Horsman, "you can't
boast of a Cave of Adullam in the
House of Lords!" "No," replied Lord
Houghton, with the readiness of a rapier
thrust, "in the House of Lords we have
nothing so <em>hollow</em>!"</p>

<p>It is extraordinary how much our
judgment of oratory is affected by our
opinion as to the point at issue. I once
heard Mr. Bright deliver a speech of
great force and beauty on the second
Reform Bill; and his speeches were
always eloquent and admirable so that
he never seemed to sink below himself.
Indeed, one secret of his splendid success
was the care and study which he
devoted to master every detail of what
he intended to say; so that&mdash;to the
astonishment of Mr. Gladstone, who had
the happy art of falling to sleep as soon
as he laid his head on the pillow&mdash;Mr.
Bright's speeches often caused him sleepless
nights. The oration to which I refer
was delivered, if I remember rightly, in
1857. I was listening with admiration
in the Speaker's gallery, when suddenly
an ardent Conservative, who was sitting
next to me, showed himself so entirely
impervious to the charm and power of
the orator that he flung himself back
in his seat with the contemptuous
remark, "I thought the fellow could
speak!"</p>

<p>This reminds me of one or two
incidents in the great debate on the
Disestablishment of the Irish Church in
the House of Lords. The Earl of
Tankerville, whose son was a boy in
my house at Harrow, had very kindly
given me a seat in the gallery, and I
heard a great part of that very famous
discussion. The learned and lovable
Archbishop Trench had to plead the
cause of his Church; but he was old
and deeply depressed, and his speech
was naturally ineffective. At the very
beginning he made an unfortunate slip,
which, trivial as it was&mdash;and it is by
no means unfrequently the case that a
"trifle light as air" makes an impression,
favourable or unfavourable, far beyond
what might seem to be its proper importance&mdash;at
once marred the effect of
what he was about to urge. For, at
the beginning of his speech, he unluckily
addressed the assembled peers as "My
brethren!"&mdash;or, as he pronounced it,
"My <em>brathren</em>"&mdash;instead of "My Lords";
and, hastily as he corrected himself, the
scarcely suppressed titter which ran
through the House was alike disconcerting
to the speaker and injurious to the
effect of his words. A stranger was
seated next to me, who was burning
with enthusiasm for the Irish Church,
and expected a powerful defence of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
position from its eminent Archbishop.
But the prelate's somewhat lachrymose
appeal seemed to him quite below the
importance of the occasion; and, with
a sigh of deep disappointment, he leaned
back with the murmur, "Oh dear! he's as
heavy as lead and as dull as ditch-water!"</p>

<p class="center">(<em>The "Rupert of Debate</em>.")</p></div>
</div>

<p>The greatest speech on that occasion was
that of the late Archbishop Magee, who
had then been recently appointed Bishop
of Peterborough. I had, shortly before,
heard his powerful sermon in St. Patrick's
Cathedral, Dublin, at the Church Congress,
while the fate of the Irish Church
was still trembling in the balance. He
had chosen the text, "And they beckoned
to their partners, who were in the other
ship, to come over and help them." The
text was so singularly appropriate that
Archdeacon Denison is said to have
started up from his seat and almost to
have clapped his hands aloud! Great
things were expected of the speech, and
the recently appointed Bishop fully rose
to the occasion. As we went out of the
House, one of the peers told me that the
late Lord Ellenborough (the famous
Viceroy of India) had pronounced Dr.
Magee's speech to be the most eloquent
he had ever heard, except one (I think)
of Lord Erskine's. Yet I could not help
fancying at the time that political
circumstances had tended to the undue
extolment of this speech&mdash;eloquent and
powerful as it undoubtedly was above
its intrinsic merits. I perfectly remember
the scene and all the circumstances,
and even the manner and accent with
which it was delivered; but neither
then nor afterwards was I at all impressed
by the arguments, nor can I
now recall them. This is far from being
the case with another speech delivered
in the same debate by Dr. Connop Thirlwall,
the very able and learned Bishop
of St. Davids. He was dealing with the
charge of "sacrilege," which was freely
brought against the Bill, and he endeavoured
to show that there were acts
which some might characterise by such
a stigma which might, on the contrary,
be deeds actuated by the highest justice
and mercy.</p>

</div>

<p>I witnessed a humorous little incident
in the House of Lords during the debate
on the Public Schools Bill. The late Earl
of Clarendon was in charge of it, and
the Earl of Derby, "the Rupert of
debate," was opposed to it. A number
of head-masters, whose methods and
interests would be affected by the Bill,
had been permitted to stand by the
throne in the part of the House where
members of the House of Commons are
allowed to take their place when they
want to hear a debate. Lord Clarendon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
in his speech was gently complaining
that Lord Derby, in characterising the
Bill, had said of it (as Lord Clarendon
misquoted it)&mdash;"Sunt bona; sunt qu&#230;dam
mediocria; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sunt pl&#365;r&#365; m&#257;la</i>." This
quotation, as the amused head-masters
instantly noticed with a smile, involved
two very glaring false quantities
on the part of the statesman who
was introducing the Bill for the improvement
of the education of the
country. Instantly Lord Derby started
up with the words, "Will the noble Lord
repeat what he has just attributed to
me?" Innocent of the little trap which
had been thus laid for him, Lord
Clarendon repeated his "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sunt pl&#365;r&#365;
m&#257;la</i>." "I never said anything of the
kind!" said Lord Derby with humorous
indignation. "I am sure," said Lord
Clarendon, "that I shall be in the recollection
of all when I repeat that the
noble Lord, though he must have forgotten
the fact, quoted the line which
I have just repeated to the House."
"Nothing of the kind!" said Lord Derby,
with great emphasis; "what <em>I</em> said was
very different. It was" (and the quotation
was emphasised by pointed finger
and slow enunciation), "'Sunt bona; sunt
qu&#230;dam mediocria; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sunt m&#365;l&#365; pl&#363;ra</i>.'"
Lord Clarendon laughed good-humouredly,
and apologised for the slip; but he was
evidently a little discomfited.</p>

<p class="center">RICHARD LALOR SHEIL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>To return for a few moments to the
House of Commons, a friend of mine
once asked Mr. Gladstone who was the
most eloquent speaker whom he had
ever heard in the House of Commons.
He answered, as he has replied to others,
"that he thought he had never heard
anyone more eloquent than Richard
Lalor Sheil." Anyone who will read Mr.
Sheil's published volume of speeches
will not be surprised at this remark.
The one celebrated outburst which is
best remembered, thrilled all who heard
it, and sounded like the sudden sweep of
a tornado. Lord Lyndhurst, in a recent
speech, had unwisely and unfairly spoken
of the Irish as "<em>aliens</em>." Alluding to
this, Mr. Sheil burst out with the fine
passage from which I will only quote a
part: "<em>Aliens!</em>" he exclaimed. "Was
Arthur Duke of Wellington in the House
of Lords, and did he not start up and
exclaim, 'Hold! I have seen the aliens
do their duty!'... On the field of
Waterloo the blood of Englishmen and
Scotchmen and Irishmen flowed in the
same stream, and drenched the same
field. When the chill morning dawned
their dead lay cold and stark together;
in the same deep pit their bodies were
deposited; the green corn of spring is
now breaking from their commingled
dust; the dew falls from heaven upon
their union in the grave. Partakers in
every peril, in the glory shall they not
be permitted to participate? And shall
we be told as a requital that we are
'<em>aliens</em>' from the noble country for
whose salvation our lifeblood was poured
out?"</p>

<p>The effect of such a passage delivered
as Richard Lalor Sheil delivered it, can
better be imagined than described. He
was a man of short figure and somewhat
insignificant appearance; and his
voice was high and shrill, and never well-modulated
like the voices of such orators
as Lord Chatham or Mr. Bright. But
he spoke with genuine feeling and
enthusiasm. The impression produced by
such earnestness can never be resisted.
The tones of passion are very penetrating,
and they vibrate in the memory.
"But did not Mr. Sheil <em>scream</em> a good
deal in his speeches, Mr. Gladstone?"
asked his friend. "Sir," was the answer,
"he was <em>all scream</em>!" And yet few
Parliamentary debaters have ever produced
a deeper impression!</p>

<h2>THE INTERVENTION OF TODDLELUMS.</h2>

<p class="center">A Complete Story. By Helen Boddington.</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/img058.jpg" alt="B" width="100" height="145" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">Bang! bang! went
the fist of Toddlelums
on the window-pane,
as the
little hand tried
to capture a
cunning fly which
always managed
to escape his
grasp. Toddlelums
was curled
up on the window-seat,
with such
big, big thoughts
coursing through
his little brain. Not unspoken thoughts.
Oh, no! Toddlelums at six always did
his thinking out loud. "Ah! you silly,
silly, little fly," he said in his cooing
voice; "I wonder what you are made
of, and where you go to when you die.
Ah!" with another bang and a little
chuckle. "I nearly caught you that
time."</p>
</div>

<p>"Toddlelums, what are you doing?"
said his mother, from the other end of
the room.</p>

<p>Toddlelums rolled off the window-seat,
picked himself up, put his hands in
the pockets of his knickers, and finally
placed himself with his back to the fire.
"I was only trying to catch one little
fly, mammie."</p>

<p>"Ah! but, my pet, it is rather cruel
to kill the poor flies."</p>

<p>"Oh! I wasn't going to kill it, only
catch it and make a tiny cage between
my two hands"&mdash;putting the palms of
his hands together&mdash;"then I would let
it fly away again, right away."</p>

<p>The mother sat there watching her
boy and thinking how like his father he
was growing. Presently he edged up to
her and leant against her knee, and then
she put her arm round him, and bent
her head so that her cheek touched
his brown curls. "Mother's baby," she
said softly; "mother's little Toddlelums,"
and there was a quaver in her voice.</p>

<p>Toddlelums did not notice it, though,
for he turned to her with a merry
twinkle in his great brown eyes and
twined his arms lovingly round her
neck. "Let's play, mammie; let's play
bears," he cried, trying to drag her out
of her chair with fearless hands which
were certain of no repulse.</p>

<p>She stood up, laughing. How tall and
graceful she was, and how young! Soft
golden hair, brown eyes like Toddlelums',
only with a sad, sad look in them even
when she smiled. Toddlelums thought his
mother was beautiful, and Toddlelums
was right. A romp was in full swing
when a man's step sounded in the hall.
In a flash the boy with his rosy face
and rumpled hair made a bolt for the
door, as a deep voice called, "Toddlelums!"</p>

<p>"It's dad, it's dad!" he shouted,
battling with the knob of the door.
Then two little feet scampered down
the hall, and Toddlelums was raised up
high into the air and smothered with
kisses. The mother was cognisant of
all this, yet she did not attempt to
follow. She merely gave little touches
to the disordered hair, took up her
work, and seated herself once again.
Where was the smile now? Where had
the tender look gone? Vanished at the
sound of a man's voice&mdash;and that man
her husband!</p>

<p>"Mammie and me were just playing
bears," said the son, as he came in
perched on his father's shoulder.
"Wasn't it fun, mammie?" looking at
his mother with a joyous smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," she answered, without
looking up; and her husband, glancing
at her, noticed that she bit her under
lip and a flush suddenly dyed her cheeks.</p>

<p>They had been married seven years,
and during that time never one word
of love had passed the lips of either. It
had been a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mariage de convenance</i>, his
and her fathers' estates joined, and, as she
told him afterwards, she had seen nobody
she liked better. It had seemed easy
enough at first even without love, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
gradually&mdash;neither knew exactly how&mdash;a
coldness sprang up, they drifted apart.
There was no actual quarrel, only a few
hard, bitter words on both sides, but the
barrier grew and grew until there seemed
little hope of its being broken down.</p>

<p>At the end of the first year Toddlelums
came, and then, if anything, matters
became worse, for all the mother's
thoughts were centred in her baby, all
her love was lavished on him&mdash;the father
was left to his own devices. As the
child grew older, instinct told him to
divide his love between father and
mother, and then cruel pangs of jealousy
visited the mother's breast.</p>

<p>So the years passed, Toddlelums with
his sweet baby voice making sunshine in
the home where lurked so many shadows.
Toddlelums never saw the shadows,
though, for mother and father vied with
each other in keeping them out of his
path.</p>

</div>

<p>During the last few months, almost
unknown to herself, something had been
stirring in Grace Millroe's heart; some
strange feeling hitherto quite foreign to
it. Perhaps it was the constant vision of
a man's grave, patient face with the
sad look on it which seemed of late to
have grown sadder. That may or may
not be; but, in any case, before she was
aware, love, which had lain dormant so
long, was awakened. Then at last, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
it came upon her with its mighty full
force it brought her only sorrow, for,
as she cried within herself, "There is so
little use in loving when there is no
return." And so this day, when her
husband came in after her game with
Toddlelums, the flush on her cheeks,
which he attributed to annoyance at
his approach, was in reality caused by
the quickened beatings of her heart.</p>

<p>Later, when Toddlelums was fast asleep
in his tiny crib and the house was silent,
she sat alone in the drawing-room and
he in his study, as was invariably
the case when there was no
visitor before whom to keep up
appearances.</p>

<p>She wanted the second volume
of the book she was reading, and
so presently she rose from her
comfortable chair near the fire,
slowly crossed the large, old-fashioned
hall, and softly opened
the study door. How cosy the
room looked, with its crimson
curtains drawn closely before the
great windows, the fire and
shaded lamp combined filling it
with ruddy light! She stood
with the knob of the door in her
hand and with her eyes riveted
on the figure at the writing-table.</p>

<p>His arms were folded on the
table, his head was buried in
them, and, surely, that was a
low, despairing moan which came
to her across the stillness!</p>

<p>"Ah!" she thought, "if he
only loved me, I could make him
happy." Then she noticed for
the first time that the black hair
was streaked with grey. Her
lips quivered, she made a step
forward; then she drew
back, passed out of the
room, and softly closed the
door after her. In the impulse
of the moment she
had intended saying some
comforting word, and then
she thought of his usual
cold, passionless look, and
refrained.</p>

<p>How could she know that
if she had made an advance
the man would have gladly,
most gladly, responded? A
few minutes after he lifted
his head, and, had she been there, she
would have seen that the face was full
of passion, and on it were deeply drawn
lines of pain.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile she bent over her
little one's cot, and, kissing the tiny
face, which was flushed with sleep, she
whispered, "Ah, my little Toddlelums! if
daddy only loved me as he loves his boy,
I would be content to die this minute,
even if I had to leave you, my baby,
behind."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/img060.jpg" width="250" height="426" alt="averted" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">She stood with her eyes riveted on the figure at the table.</p></div>
</div>

<p>And yet, after all the passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
feeling of the night, when morning came
they met&mdash;outwardly, at least&mdash;with the
usual cool indifference in their bearing
towards each other. At breakfast Toddlelums
was with them in his white pinafore,
seated on a high chair which was
drawn up very close to the table.</p>

<p>"Mammie," he said, "may nurse take
me down to the river to play with
Frankie Darrel this afternoon? We
want to swim our boats."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear, but you must swim them
in the shallow part."</p>

<p>"And don't get too near the edge, old
chap. Remember, if you roll in, daddy
won't be there to fetch you out, and
you'll be gobbled up by the little
fishes."</p>

<p>Toddlelums was looking at his father
with great, round eyes. "Gobbled up
by the little fishes?" he echoed; but his
father did not hear, for he was saying in
an undertone to his wife, "Tell nurse to
be careful; the river is swollen after the
rain."</p>

<p>Afternoon came, and off went Toddlelums,
carrying in his arms a boat with
big, white sails, while the young mother
threw kisses to him as she drove away
in the carriage.</p>

<p>Ah, little Toddlelums, go your way,
sail your small craft! Unconsciously,
you will guide it through the deep
waters, but the land will be reached at
last!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was evening, and Grace Millroe,
entering the hall on her return from her
drive, found her husband standing at
the foot of the stairs apparently waiting
for her, with a look on his face which
she had never seen there before. He
made no movement, one hand clutched
the balustrade with a tight grip, and
twice his drawn lips opened to say
words which refused to come. She
rushed to his side&mdash;she clung to his
arm, while the fair face, working with
some wild, fearful emotion, looked imploringly
into his. "Edgar, what is it?
What is the matter?"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img061.jpg" width="450" height="299" alt="mammie" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Daddy, you do love mammie, don't you?"</p></div>
</div>

<p>"It is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is Toddlelums. Oh, Edgar! for
mercy's sake, don't say it is Toddlelums!"
and her hold tightened on his arm.</p>

<p>He turned his head away, for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
could not bear to see the agony on her
face.</p>

<p>"Yes, Grace, it is Toddlelums. He fell
into the water, but&mdash;ah! don't look like
that&mdash;he may live yet, the doctors are
doing their best for him."</p>

<p>Together, mother and father ascended
the stairs, she faltering on every step,
while hard, dry sobs shook her frame.
Ah! what a wan, white Toddlelums lay
on his little bed, and, but for the faint
breathing, the mother must have known
herself childless. The doctors were doing
their work, while the agonised parents
stood watching and waiting. She would
have clasped him in her arms&mdash;she
would have pressed his little cold body
to her breast&mdash;but first the doctors
had their part to do; the mother must
wait.</p>

<p>"Edgar," and she turned to him with
great, dry eyes, "will my baby die? No,
no, it cannot be!" she moaned plaintively.
"It would kill me to lose my
little Toddlelums."</p>

<p>"Dear," he said, and somehow she felt
comfort in knowing that his arms were
round her; "if I could, I would give my
life for his."</p>

<p>"No, no," she said, and then she sprang
to the bedside; for the doctors had
moved away, and Toddlelums was calling
"Mammie."</p>

<p>"Mother's darling, mother's precious
baby!" she cried, twining her arms round
him.</p>

<p>"And daddy's too," said the weak little
voice, for Toddlelums was a very shadowy
Toddlelums still.</p>

<p>"Yes, and daddy's too," she said, as the
man bent over his son and held one tiny
hand.</p>

<p>"Daddy, you do love mammie, don't you?
He said, that horrid Frankie said, that
you hated each other"&mdash;looking at the two
faces. "He said he knew it was true
because he heard his mother and father
say so. And I told him it was a big,
big story, and I fighted him hard&mdash;very
hard&mdash;and then he gave me a push, and
I went down, down into the cold water.
It isn't true, daddy, is it?" looking at
his father with great, earnest eyes; "you
do love my mammie?" and he stroked
her face tenderly.</p>

<p>The man hesitated, looked across at
the woman; then he said, "Yes, darling,
I love her more than my life."</p>

<p>A few seconds of silence, a sigh of content
from Toddlelums. Then the mother's
voice saying, "And I love my little child,
but I love his father more."</p>

<p>Eyes meet eyes, hands clasp hands, and
the two hearts severed so long are united
at last.</p>

<p>Blessed little Toddlelums, with your
sweet baby face and your manly little
heart!&mdash;gallantly you fought your first
battle, and the victory is yours. The
deep waters encompassed you, and the
Valley of the Shadow was very near;
but the Captain of the Host has yet a
greater battle for you to fight, and that
is the Battle of Life.</p>

<p class="cap_1">Where are they? Rather,
where are they not?
Dispersed to the four
corners of the earth,
this nation of exiles,
ever loyal to the
Government under
which they live, still
look for a better
country and fix their eyes on Palestine,
their ancient home. One of their learned
men, Dr. Hertzl, has lately appealed to
his fellow-Jews to rise and re-people the
land. But nothing can be done, he tells
them, without the enthusiasm of the
whole nation: "The idea must make its
way into the most distant and miserable
holes where the people dwell."</p>

<p>It was just at a time when the Philistines
said, "Behold the Hebrews come forth
out of their holes where they had hid
themselves," that Israel's captivity was
turned to freedom. It may be that history
will repeat itself.</p>

of an indestructible people have been
discovered. They wear the dress of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
natives and submit to their laws, but
century after century they have remained,
proof against absorption. Neither
poverty, contempt, nor persecution shakes
their belief&mdash;the faith that is the heritage
of their fathers&mdash;that they are the remnant
of a chosen people.</p>

<p>Jerusalem will see an amazing sight if
it calls upon all the remotest holes and
corners to deliver up its children. Jews
white, black, and brown from India, dusky
from Abyssinia, arrayed in the costume
and sporting the pigtail of China, as well
as Jews rich and poor, high and humble,
from Europe and America&mdash;all will bring
with them the divers ways, tongues, and
customs of their adopted countries, and
assemble as one nation.</p>

</div>

<p>Amongst the most remote colonies are
the Jews of China, who have aroused
interesting inquiry and been the theme
of many French writers. Early in the
seventeenth century, and shortly after
the Italian missionaries had come to
Pekin, one of them, Matthew Ricci,
received a morning call. His visitor
wore the gorgeous Chinese dress, including
the queue; but the figure and face
were not Mongolian, and the smiling
countenance was not in keeping with
the dignified solemnity of a Chinaman.
This gentleman's name was Ngai, and
he had heard of the arrival of some
foreigners who worshipped one Lord of
heaven and earth, and who yet were
not Mohammedans; he belonged to the
same religion, he explained, and had
called to make their acquaintance.</p>

<p class="center">A MISSION-SCHOOL GROUP OF INDIAN JEWS.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Now Master Ngai made it clear that
he was an Israelite, a native of Kae-fung-foo,
the capital of Honan. He had
come to Pekin to pass an examination
for a mandarin degree, and had been
led by curiosity and brotherly feeling
to call at the mission house. In his
native city, he said, there were ten or
twelve families of Israelites, and a synagogue
which they had recently restored
at the expense of 10,000 crowns, and
they had a roll of the law four or five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">&nbsp;</a><br /><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
hundred years old. The missionary's
letters described this synagogue. It
occupied a space of between three and
four hundred feet in length by about a
hundred and fifty in breadth, and was
divided into four courts. It had borrowed
some decorative splendour from
China. The inscription in Hebrew,
"Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God is
one Lord, blessed be the name of the
glory of His Kingdom for ever and ever,"
and the Ten Commandments were emblazoned
in gold. Silken curtains inclosed
the "Bethel" which enshrined
the sacred books, and which only the
Rabbi might enter during the time of
prayer.</p>

<p>Every detail of this place, with its
incense, its furniture, and all its types of
good things yet to come, is interesting.
There in the last century the children
of Israel at Kae-fung-foo worshipped the
God of their fathers with the rites that
pointed to the Messiah of whose advent,
as far as it can be ascertained, they never
heard until the arrival of the Italian missionaries.
Learned men have entered into
discussions as to whether these people
were Jews or Israelites, whether they came
to China from the Assyrian captivity or
the Roman dispersion. They themselves
say that their forefathers came from the
West; and it is probable that the settlers
arrived by way of Khorassan and Samerkand.
They must have been numerous
in the ninth century, for two Mohammedan
travellers of that period describe
a rebel, named Bae-choo, taking Canton
by storm in <small>A.D.</small> 877 and slaughtering
120,000 Jews, Mohammedans, Christians,
and Parsees. More than one Jew of
Kae-fung-foo is known to have gained
the right to wear the little round button
on the top of his cap so dear to the
ambition of a Chinaman. The Tai-ping
Rebellion dispersed the settlement, and
the remnant who remain faithful to the
memory of old traditions are chiefly poor
and distressed. The Chinamen distinguish
them by the name of "T'iao chiao" (the
sect which pulls out the sinew), for these
"children of Israel eat not of the sinew
which shrank, which is upon the hollow of
the thigh, unto this day." They are said
to often repeat the words of the dying
Jacob, "I have waited for Thy salvation,
O Lord." This is to them like the cry
of an infant in the night. They have
waited so long that it is little wonder
if the words have lost their triumphant
ring and their ancient accompaniment
of faith in future blessings.</p>

<p class="center">(<em>From an Original Drawing by a Persian Jew.</em>)</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Persian Jews, from whom the
colony in China sprang, are interspersed
over the Shah's country. The missionaries
of the London Society for Promoting
Christianity amongst the Jews make
long tours to seek them out and shepherd
them. A convert from amongst
them, the Rev. M. Norollah, found in
1890 that of his own people in Isfahan,
numbering 5,000, not more than ten could
read or write the language of the country.
He started a school for the children
in the very heart of this Mohammedan
city. This school and others besides
have flourished, and been the means of
making friends with the parents.</p>

<p>Of all the colonies in Asia, none seems
to have preserved their traditions more
carefully and lived up to them more
worthily than the Jews in India. According
to the last census, they number,
17,180.</p>

<p>Privileged travellers in the south-west
have been shown a charter much
older than the great English pledge of
liberty. The first glance is not imposing.
It is a copper plate, scratched with letters
of such out-of-date character that they
bear little resemblance to any that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
now in use. But this is a priceless
treasure to the Jews of Malabar. Some
authorities believe it was granted about
the year <small>A.D.</small> 500; others say that the
renowned Ceram Perumal was the donor,
and this prince appears to have been in
the zenith of his power in <small>A.D.</small> 750. All
agree that the charter is at least a
thousand years old.</p>

<p>According to the native annals of Malabar
and the Jews' own traditions, 10,000
emigrants arrived on the coast about
<small>A.D.</small> 70, shortly after the destruction of
the Second Temple and the final desolation
of Jerusalem. It is supposed that
of these 7,000 at once settled on a spot
then called Mahodranpatna, but now
known as Cranganore.</p>

<p>Unhappily, this flourishing community
fell out amongst themselves. After Jewish
emigrants from Spain and other countries
joined them a dispute arose, and they
called an Indian king to settle it. The
fable of the quarrel for an oyster was
illustrated. The mediator took possession
of the place; the fat oyster became his,
and death and captivity represented the
shells which he divided amongst the disputants.
Some fugitives obtained an
asylum from the Rajah of Cochin, and
built a little town on a piece of ground
which he granted to them, close to his
palace.</p>

<p>In this lovely native state live their
descendants&mdash;two classes of Jews, one
known as the Jerusalem or White Jews,
the other as the Black Jews. The White
trace their descent from the first settlers;
throughout the centuries they have preserved
the fair skin, fine features, and
broad, high foreheads that usually belong
to Europe, whilst amongst the men blonde
or reddish curly beards prevail. The
Black Jews are too intensely black to be
akin to the Hindoos; they are said to
have sprung from Jewish proselytes from
amongst the aboriginal races of the district.
The Black and White Jews inhabit
the same quarter of the town of Cochin;
they follow the same customs, join in
the same forms of prayer, but never
intermarry.</p>

<p>The Jews of Cochin seem to excel all
others scattered over India in strict
religious observances, but they are apparently
quite distinct from the Jews
or the Beni Israel of the north and
west. Some ladies of the Church of
England Zenana Missionary Society were
welcomed into the houses of Jewesses
in Calcutta. They recognised the noticeably
Jewish features, in spite of the
clear brunette complexion which belonged
to neither the White nor Black Jews
of the south. This community availed
themselves of day schools and Sunday
schools started for the children, which
have now become part of the organisation
of the Old Church Hebrew Mission, and
responded to friendly overtures. One
Jewish lady spoke to her visitors of the
return of her people to Jerusalem, and
she said, "We will go in your arms."
"You will probably go in our railway
trains," answered the Englishwoman,
and this idea satisfied both.</p>

<p>The Beni Israel, or Sons of Israel, of
the north and west say that their first
ancestors in India were persecuted refugees
from Persia, seven men and seven
women who escaped from a shipwreck
near Chaul, about thirty miles south-east
of Bombay, and managed to save a
Hebrew copy of the Pentateuch. Some
assert that this happened eight hundred,
others one thousand six hundred years
ago. Their number is now reckoned as
upwards of 5,000. They are said to resemble
the Arabian Jews in features.
They keep strictly the Mosaic fasts and
feasts, yet in many houses visited by the
ladies of the Zenana Bible and Medical
Mission, the New as well as the Old Testament
is studied.</p>

<p>For nearly half a century a principal
man of the community has been in the
service of the Free Church of Scotland
at Alibag, about twenty-four miles to the
south of the city of Bombay. For in
this place, at one time famous as the
centre of a small pirate kingdom, handsome,
intelligent children, with marked
Semitic features, and names familiar in
the Book of Genesis, delight in attending
school.</p>

<p>In Karachi the Beni Israel are also
numerous. One of the missionaries of
the Church of England Zenana Missionary
Society, who work amongst them, was
invited to a wedding in the synagogue.
She noticed that, as a part of the ceremony,
the bride received a cup, and after
raising it to her lips threw it down and
broke it. This, some of the guests explained,
was a sign that even in the
midst of their mirth they remembered
Jerusalem with sorrow.</p>

<p>To many, such words and symbols are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
very real. During the present year a
rich Jew of Karachi has left his adopted
home to build a synagogue in Jerusalem,
where the Sultan has shown the Jews
great toleration.</p>

<p>But though the Turkish Empire has
been a refuge for them, none can exceed
the Mohammedans in cruelty and intolerance
when they are roused to fanatical
zeal for their Prophet. This has
been specially manifest in Africa. Abyssinia,
perhaps, has the oldest colony of
Jews. They go by the name of Falashas,
which means exiles or emigrants, and
claim an ambitious origin. King Solomon,
they believe, added the Queen of Sheba
to his many wives, and their son Menelek
was educated in Jerusalem. On his growing
to manhood, the Jewish nobles foresaw
political disturbances, and begged
the king to send him to his mother.
King Solomon consented on condition
that each Jew should send his first-born
son with Menelek to Abyssinia. There
he became king of Abyssinia, and his
Israelite companions married native
women, so a new nation sprang into
existence.</p>

<p>Traditions of noble descent are of less
value than nobility of character in the
descendants. The church amongst the
Falashas has been sown in the blood
of martyrs. When the followers of the
Mahdi became masters of Western Abyssinia,
they massacred or made captives
all the inhabitants who had not secured
safety by flight. Jews and Christians,
whether men or women, had to choose
between Mohammed and death. A Falasha
family, converts of the London Society
for Promoting Christianity amongst the
Jews, were overtaken by the Mahdists.
They were told to say the Mohammedan
creed, "<i lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">Allah ilahu ill Allah wa Mohammed
e rasah Allah</i>." These few words
would save their lives, but these words
would deny their Master.</p>

<p>"Never will we deny Him Who died
for us on the cross," they answered.
"We are born Falashas, but have been
converted to Christ. He is our Saviour,
and not Mohammed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The parents were strong to endure, but
could they bear to see their five children
put to a cruel death? They not only
lived through this ordeal, but the father
encouraged the younger martyrs. "It is
only a short suffering," he cried, "and
you will gain the crown of everlasting
life." Then came the mother's turn.
Only let her deny Christ and she might
live. Her heart and her voice were
broken, but she managed to answer
clearly, "I love Him, I do not fear death."
Her husband saw her butchered. His
courage rose higher when his tormentors
offered him not only life but riches&mdash;anything
that he chose to ask&mdash;if he would
become a Mohammedan. "You may torture
me, you may cut me in pieces, I
will not deny Him Who died for me."
He too joined the white-robed army of
martyrs&mdash;a spectacle to other captives,
one of whom afterwards escaped and
described the scene.</p>

<p>Six years ago the Falashas themselves
became persecutors. They brought a
prisoner in chains before the Governor
of the province. They could find no
charge against this ex-Falasha priest
except that he had become a Christian;
and therefore they declared that it would
be a God-pleasing work to kill him. The
Governor warned the Falashas that they
would be punished if they attempted to
take his life. Then he asked his prisoner
if he would again become a Falasha, or
if he chose to risk being robbed or beheaded.
"I go to my Lord and to my
Father," answered the dignified old man.
"I would rather die than continue in life
as an apostate."</p>

</div>

<p>The situation was suddenly reversed.
Instead of passing sentence, the Governor
said, "Honoured father, give me your
blessing." Faith and meekness had gained
the victory over violence.</p>

<p>In North Africa the Jews have adopted
many Mohammedan customs. Child marriage,
for instance, has become a curse
amongst them. Sometimes men of forty
wed little wives of eight or ten. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
same time, in Morocco, an independent
Moslem empire, the purity of their lives
is in noticeable contrast to their neighbours.
Algeria, where the Jews number
50,000, as well as Tunisia, is under French
protection. It is little wonder if the
anti-Jewish feeling of the French in
Algiers should rouse an anti-Christian
feeling in the Jews, and that here their
opposition should be added to the many
difficulties that meet Christian missions
in Moslem lands. But many Jews rise
superior to prejudices, and missionaries
of the North Africa Mission find refreshment
in studying the Scriptures with
Hebrew scholars and Hebrew seekers
after more light. In 1897, on the fast
of Gedaliah, a missionary attended the
synagogue. His friend, the Rabbi, mentioned
his presence, and the worshippers,
all of them pure Arabs and dressed
accordingly, pronounced a benediction
on him and commended him to God's
grace.</p>

<p>Tyranny and dispersion have failed
to exterminate the Jews. In the name
of patriotism, the king of Egypt made
their life a burden. In the name of
religion and reverence for the Holy
Sepulchre, the Crusaders brought horrible
calamities upon them. In the name of
uniformity, but with special reference
to the Jews, the machinery of
the Inquisition was set at work in
Spain. Yet the 3,000,000 slaves who
came out of Egypt have
increased, as far as
it can be calculated, to four
times the number. Their
affliction has been a refining
furnace. From the
day when Moses, himself
a Hebrew fugitive,
turned aside to see why
an insignificant mimosa
bush was not consumed
by a devouring fire, the
history of the chosen
people has been a witness
of the unchangeableness
of God's Word: "I am
the Lord, I change not;
therefore ye sons of Jacob
are not consumed."</p>

<h3>A LETTER OF APOLOGY.</h3>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/img073b.jpg" alt="T" width="100" height="103" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">The afternoon's summer
sun shone in on
the chestnut head
of a girl, bent
sedulously over a
book. She was
Marjorie Bethune,
only daughter of
one of the minor
canons of Norham.
She was hard at
work constructing
a sonnet, to the accompaniment of the great
organ in the cathedral, where her father was
taking the service. The words of the psalms
and anthem were almost audible, as well as
their music, through the open windows, stimulating
the girl's reluctant fancy. There were
other helps, too, to her imagination&mdash;the
twitter of birds in the flowering trees near
the further window, the hum of the bees in
the lime-trees, the scents of syringa and lilies.</p>
</div>

<p>The room in which she sat had a much-lived-in
air and a pleasant old-fashioned
shabbiness of aspect. There was a large
round table covered with papers and books,
calf-bound and large for the greater part&mdash;the
books and litter of a scholar. Books also
were heaped on the quaint spindle-legged
side-table with deep drawers, ornamented
with carving and brass Tudor roses; and
wherever in the room was any wall-space
low bookshelves of a peculiar pattern filled
it. The wall-colouring above was a rich tan
and red, the whole making a harmonious
background to the girl's burnished head and
brilliantly fair complexion.</p>

<p>A sudden thought seemed to strike her. She
lifted her eyes to the further end of the room,
where on a sofa near the pretty window lay
a fragile-looking woman. The extreme youthfulness
of her appearance was not contradicted
by the brilliancy of the beautiful dark eyes
she turned now on Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Mother, I wish you would tell me exactly
what father said when he proposed to you.
I suppose he did propose?" questioningly,
gazing in doubtful sympathy at the colour
flooding her mother's face at her question.</p>

<p>"You will know for yourself some day,
Marjorie," Mrs. Bethune said softly.</p>

<p>"I? But I want to know now. Just the
facts. You can't make up things on nothing,"
disconsolately. "Our literary guild next
month wants a poem&mdash;a sonnet by preference&mdash;on
Love. Such a subject! I could imagine
a lot. But I don't know."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bethune's eyes were full of laughter,
but her face was grave as she looked at her
discontented young daughter.</p>

<p>"People's experiences vary," she said
reminiscently.</p>

<p>"Do they? But yours would do, mother&mdash;just
to get a fact for a foundation. Love
seems such a shimmery, slippery thing."</p>

<p>"It was behind the door&mdash;at a party first.
He had asked me to look at a picture&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Behind the door! Father!" exclaimed
Marjorie, breaking in on the reminiscence.
"Oh, mother!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Bethune laughed. "You'll understand
some day, Marjorie. That was the beginning;
after that, I kept out of his way&mdash;&mdash;"
She paused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes?" said Marjorie interestedly. "I
don't wonder. Behind the door! I couldn't
put that in a sonnet."</p>

<p>"It was difficult to meet alone," went on
the mother. "We lived four miles apart,
And I was afraid. I didn't want him to
speak, and yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Didn't you love him then? Perhaps I
could put that. Or did loving him make
you shy?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But he was masterful&mdash;he found
a way."</p>

<p>"Masterful," mused Marjorie, much exercised
at this new presentation of her
scholarly father. "Then love alters characters,
if it made father masterful and you
shy. Well, those are at least some facts.
Thank you. What else, mother? Tell me
exactly, please."</p>

<p>"One day after lunch, when he had come
over, I remembered that I had dropped my
thimble under the table, and I went back
to the dining-room to look for it."</p>

<p>"And he followed?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he followed, and he then and there
proposed."</p>

<p>"But, mother," with misgivings, "do you
think that was sonnet-sort of love?"</p>

<p>"Sure of it, Margie."</p>

<p>"It sounds so ordinary. However, I wanted
facts," in a tone of resigned dejection.</p>

<p>Impatient steps sounded in the hall. Hats
and books were flung down outside, and
two boys of seven and nine respectively came
into the room. Marjorie's glance fell upon
her young brothers dispassionately, staying
her reflections on love.</p>

<p>"You look as if you had been in mischief,"
she remarked, as a certain air of
agitation conveyed itself to her perception.</p>

<p>"Yes; and found out, too," said Sandy,
the seven-year-old, disgustedly.</p>

<p>"You know that new man at 'The Ridges,'
mother," burst in the older boy. "He's had
the cheek to say we're not to go that way
any more."</p>

<p>"But have you been, David, since the
General died?"</p>

<p>"Of course we have, mother; why not?
I'd got the keys."</p>

<p>"As if keys mattered anyhow!" put in
Sandy. "Anyone can climb over that wanted
to. It's the nearest way."</p>

<p>"But it's private ground, not a public
path. Only the General was kind to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, and this man's a beast," viciously.</p>

<p>Then he went on, with a pretty little lisp
between the two lost teeth left on a field
of battle: "But we've had some fun all
these weeks, mother, dodging the work-people.
They couldn't find out how we got
in and out," delightedly, "even when we forgot
the keys; there's always holes, somewhere.
We didn't let 'em know; we just 'peared,
and walked past the house, riling them.
And if they ran us, didn't we just dodge
'em down the hill!"</p>

<p>"And now he says," put in David, "that
he's written to father, and that he'll have
no trespassing. Trespassing, indeed!"</p>

<p>"An' Dave called back that he was the
trespasser, 'trudin' where he wasn't wanted,"
said Sandy gleefully, "an' that he'd better
go back to Blackton, an' not fink he could
come here and be a gentleman, cos no one
would look at him!"</p>

<p>"Oh, David," said his mother reproachfully,
"how could you? He will think we
don't grow gentlemen here."</p>

<p>"Don't care for his thinks," muttered David.
"Heard Charity and Mrs. Lytchett say it."</p>

<p>"No, David," put in Marjorie. "Charity
said anyone from Blackton would feel like an
intrusion, and all Mrs. Lytchett said was, that
if he didn't like it he could always go back."</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I said, too, on'y the
words came different."</p>

<p>"If he finks we're goin' all that way round
twice a day, he's jolly w'ong," remarked
Sandy injuredly. "We'd have to start hours
an' hours earlier&mdash;not us!"</p>

<p>Again the door opened, and a tall man
came in, whose first look of anxious inquiry
was directed towards the table where his
papers were lying. Sandy's impatient elbow
was dug into the middle of them, as he
fidgeted about on one leg. Mr. Bethune
sat down in the three-cornered chair before
the table, and rescued his papers, at the
same time keeping Sandy by his side.</p>

<p>"So you two have been in mischief again?"
he said gently, looking gravely at his sons.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid David has been rude, too," put
in the mother, a little anxiously.</p>

<p>David, with a put-on air of unconcern,
looked out of the window, where two more
sturdy boys, younger, but made after the
same pattern as the two inside, were now
visible on the garden path. They were
dilatorily obeying a call from Marjorie, and
making for the window.</p>

<p>"I have had a letter," went on Mr. Bethune.
"It's a nice letter, and what Mr. Pelham says
is reasonable."</p>

<p>"Bounder!" muttered David, and Sandy
said "Beast!"</p>

<p>The father lifted his eyes from the letter.</p>

<p>"You will have to apologise. Mr. Pelham
is quite right. You have no business there.
I will write a letter, and you will take it.
Marjorie, will you see if tea is ready?" in a
fatigued tone. "Mother looks tired out."</p>

<p>"Come, boys," said Marjorie. And the
clamour that immediately ensued round the
tea-table in the next room showed that
rebellion and anarchy were in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>When they had gone their father laughed
quietly.</p>

<p>"It is a nice letter. I expect they will
find he will give them leave, if they behave
themselves. But they have been playing
tricks on the workmen&mdash;and on his servants,
as I gather."</p>

<p>"They are always in mischief," said their
mother, and her tone was not the tone of
one who lamented. "But they are not
generally rude. I am afraid they have heard
the things that are being said against this
man. Perhaps Marjorie had better go with
them? He will not be rude to her?"</p>

<p>"No. 'This man,' as you call him, is one
of the Pelhams of Lente. Yes, she can take
them. Mrs. Lytchett was suggesting to me
just now that she was growing up, and
that she ought to have some lessons&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I wish Mrs. Lytchett would mind her
own business!" flashed out the mother.
"Marjorie is as well educated as she is,
though I should be sorry to see her so
meddlesome."</p>

<p>Then her ill-temper vanished, and she
smiled serenely.</p>

<p>"Marjorie was writing a sonnet on Love
whilst you were at church. She seemed
quite equal to the composition, but lacked
facts."</p>

<p>"Marjorie's lack of facts doesn't often
curb her imagination," her father said. "I
do not think it was her education that
Mrs. Lytchett thought wanted improving&mdash;though
it does&mdash;but her deportment, whatever
that is, and&mdash;and manners."</p>

<p>"She carries herself like a queen," asserted
her mother, "even though she is thin and
awkward yet. And her manners&mdash;should you
wish them altered, father?"</p>

<p>"She is ours, my dear," he said tenderly;
"and I think her simplicity natural and
charming. But perhaps she has said something&mdash;she
does sometimes&mdash;to Mrs. Lytchett."</p>

<p>"She does often. Mrs. Lytchett was here
yesterday. I know she is good, but she is
irritating, John. She condoled with me
about your litter, and wondered if I couldn't
arrange a room for you up in the attics. And
she said she was sure all the boys were behaving
badly in church on Sunday afternoon&mdash;and
why didn't Marjorie sit between them,
instead of at the end of the pew, where the
corner was a temptation to her to lounge?
And then she made a set at the stocking
basket, and criticised the darning, and pitied
us dreadfully for so many boys, all with knees,
as well as red heads. And then Marjorie
broke out. She thought the heads were
beautiful, also the knees, and that the boys
behaved in church like saints; and that you'd
be miserable in the attics without me&mdash;though
she could understand that with a nagging
woman always about a man must have somewhere
to hide himself."</p>

<p>"I hope Marjorie won't turn into a virago,"
her father said anxiously, after a pause.
"That was rude, even if it were true. She
is cramped here&mdash;it is a cramping place; and
we are to blame&mdash;we put too much upon
her."</p>

<p>He sighed, and rose to take his wife's cup,
and then stretched himself before the fireless
grate. "She has a dangerous gift of imagination.
Will she ever be satisfied with Warde?
I have told him he may speak now. But
she is a child still, she has no idea&mdash;&mdash;" he
paused.</p>

<p>An inroad of boys, come to be inspected
by their mother before starting on their
errand, brought their father back to the
table and the letter they were to take. Sandy,
balancing on the arm of his chair, superintended
its composition.</p>

<p>"Father's put 'Dear Sir,' 'stead of 'Horrid
Fellow,'" he announced aloud to the others.
They were standing round the table; the
smallest of them, aged three, could just rest
his chin upon it, and was listening in solemn
admiration of Sandy's sentiments.</p>

<p>"Are you going to take all this horde with
you, Marjorie?" her mother asked, her observant
eyes glancing from collar to collar and
from boot to boot.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother; I thought it would economise
matters. They're all mischievous, and will
need apologising for some time; it is such
a convenient way to school."</p>

<p>"'My little sons will, I hope, make their
'pologies in person for their rudeness. I am
extwemely sorry&mdash;&mdash;'" sang out Sandy, raising
himself on his elbows, dug into the table,
the better to see what his father was
writing.</p>

<p>"Don't put 'little,' father," he pleaded;
"he'll think it's Ross or Orme, 'stead of us."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know what an apology is,
Sandy?" Mr. Bethune bethought himself to
inquire as he finished writing, and looked
down at the curly head bobbing across his
arm.</p>

<p>"Ought to," grunted Sandy, panting in his
efforts to plant his toes between the spokes
of his father's chair. "Never do so no more&mdash;till
next time."</p>

<p>"If it is that, I shall be sorry, Sandy, in
this case, because this gentleman's a stranger."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Sandy, dropping to the floor
and glancing up into the grave blue eyes, of
which his own were an exact reproduction,
without the gravity.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 416px;">
<img src="images/img076.jpg" width="416" height="600" alt="Mischief" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"You look as if you had been in mischief," she remarked.&mdash;<em>p. 67.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>"'Pologies is funny things," he said, pensively.
"Mrs. Lytchett said we ought to
be whipped when we made the peacocks
scream, an' we 'pologises; and Charity boxed
Dave's ears for treadin' on her fine new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">&nbsp;</a><br /><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
frock, an' he 'pologised&mdash;an' the Dean 'pologised
back for her crossness. An' now, seems as if
'pologies did 'stead of leavin' off doin' what
you want. Them peacocks screamed again
to-day at dinner-time, an' to-morrer we&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A quick frown from his elder brother
stopped the admission that was coming.</p>

<p>"Your morality, your deductions, and your
grammar are equally matched, Sandy," said
his father. "Who is going to carry this
letter?"</p>

<p>"Me, me!" implored the baby, advancing
a chubby hand, plucked from his mouth for
the purpose. He looked like one of Sir
Joshua's cherubs&mdash;nothing visible of him over
the edge of the table but a round moon face
of exquisite fairness, with a large background
of soft white hat instead of cloud.</p>

<p>"You'll see that the boys behave and
apologise properly, Marjorie," her father said,
sinking back into his chair with such an expression
of peace on his face as quite compensated
his young daughter for the annoyance
of the errand on which she was conducting
her young brothers.</p>


<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>ANTONY PELHAM.</h3>

<p>The surroundings of Norham Cathedral
were the great attraction of the little
town to Antony Pelham. Large,
airy houses, set in gardens to match,
with here and there a field running down to
the street, formed one side of the main
thoroughfare of the town. It was wide
and shady, bounded on its other side by
the Canons' Walk, a gravelled terrace, extending
the whole length of the cathedral
graveyard, over-arched by "immemorial elms,"
where the rooks, year after year, cawed their
noisy affairs into the ears of those below. At
the eastern end of the cathedral the Canons'
Court terminated the Walk, and provided
residences for the minor canons almost under
the cathedral walls. The Deanery stood at
one end of the Court, and the gardens of all
the houses extended southwards to enclosed
fields called the Parks, on which also the
grounds of the old palace, on the southern
side of the cathedral, abutted.</p>

<p>Beyond the boundaries of the Cathedral
Precincts the town developed into a small,
compact area of shops, and then sprawled on
into suburbs. These, called respectively
Easton and Weston, had little to do with each
other, and less with the exclusive Precincts.
They had a church and parish apiece, served
by two of the minor canons.</p>

<p>The spacious houses round the cathedral
had been built originally to serve as town
houses for the county families. They were
now often used as dower houses, or pleasant
homes to retire to from the active work of
life. Their owners formed a sufficiently large
circle to make society pleasant, but they
admitted no one into their midst who was
not "one of them."</p>

<p>When old General Orme died, he left no
one to occupy the fine old house on the hill
called "The Ridges," beyond which the
"Green," with its complement of houses&mdash;also
old, but filling the more useful <em>r&#244;les</em> of
Grammar School, Sessions House, and such like&mdash;descended
into the valley. Here, as far off
as possible, the necessary lock-up and railway
station hid their commonness out of sight.</p>

<p>It was with amazement, and incredulity at
his audacity, that the news gradually was
received of the purchase of "The Ridges,"
by Antony Pelham, a lawyer from the big
town of Blackton, eight miles away. This
manufacturing town had superseded Norham
as the county town&mdash;since which it was
scarcely ever mentioned, much less visited,
by the Norhamites. Not only had he bought
"The Ridges" but, with an extraordinary
fatuity, he meant to go on with his business
and travel backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>After hearing this, nobody troubled to make
any further inquiries about him&mdash;he was
beneath notice. It was stated by the neighbours
whose grounds adjoined his that an
army of workmen had been sent from somewhere,
and were, of course, making a wreck
of the beautiful old house. But no interest
was taken in their proceedings, except by
David and Sandy Bethune, who rapturously
availed themselves of the kindly circumstances
attending his advent. The short
cut to school on the Green, up a gravelled
path on the edge of the field, which the old
General had put at the service of his friends
who wished to visit the Green, had become
lately to the Bethune boys a way to bliss.
Marjorie and her brothers now slowly ascended
the hill to "The Ridges" by this path.</p>

<p>As they walked along, more like owners
than suppliants for forgiveness, David pointed
out to his sister the hiding-places they had
found convenient. Marjorie's own conscience
was asleep on the matter, and she did not
put herself out to rebuke him. The man was
angry. Her father had written that his boys
would apologise. She supposed they would.
They were generally able to do so when
necessary, without in the least considering
themselves bound thereby as to future action.</p>

<p>Marjorie looked with interest at the places
pointed out to her on the way up. She even
enlarged a hole in the undergrowth to admit
Sandy's plump body. But a vague irresolution
and faint sense of discomfort came
into her mind as the old red-brick house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
came in sight, and a blaze of colour from
the flower-beds before the windows struck
upon her vision.</p>

<p>"Boys," she said, softly, "David, you will
be nice, even if this man is a cad. Do you
hear, Sandy?" she said more sternly, as
Sandy panted to her side, returning from
some exploration.</p>

<p>"All right," said Sandy; "there he is!"</p>

<p>They had emerged from the shrubbery path
and had reached the edge of the lawn, which
was divided from the long field by some
white palings. Steadying herself by these, and
an occasional grip at her father's trousers, as
he walked beside her, was a little two-year-old
girl. Her nurse was visible at some distance,
sitting at needlework under the trees.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img078.jpg" width="450" height="464" alt="Sir" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Father's put 'Dear Sir,' 'stead of 'Horrid Fellow,'" he announced.&mdash;<em>p. 68.</em></p></div>
</div>

<p>Undecided whether to advance on to the
lawn, or to go further and ring at the
front-door bell, Marjorie paused. The man's
back was towards her. It did not present
the appearance she had somehow expected.
Why her imagination should have invested
the new-comer with the attributes of a vulgar
old man she could not afterwards recollect.
But she had expected this. Instead,
the back was young, and slim, and well-coated;
and the finely poised head above it
was adorned with a crop of short dark curls.
Seeing him thus, Marjorie was conscious of
a little embarrassment. A filtering doubt,
creeping through her mind, made her give
a hasty glance round at her young brothers.</p>

<p>David's eyes were glaring at the figure of
his enemy, his face wearing an expression of
deep disgust. Sandy had put on the air of
jaunty unconcern with which he always met
a difficulty. Ross, aged four, was looking
distrustfully at the baby, whilst only on little
Orme's cherubic face was there any appreciation
of the situation. He gave an exclamation
of delight, unloosed his hand from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
relaxing grasp of Marjorie, and hurried over
the grass, head foremost, as was his wont
when in a hurry. This youngest Bethune,
like his brothers before him, had a sociable
disposition; and was apt at making friends
of every person, especially every infant person,
he came near. From the private study
of the Bishop&mdash;whereto his way was by a
friendly window&mdash;to the cottage hearths he
occasionally visited through convenient open
doors when on his rambles&mdash;Orme Bethune
was a welcome guest. To him girl-babies
were a special fascination. He made advances
to this one immediately.</p>

<p>Sitting down on the grass, to accommodate
his three years to her two, he essayed to
draw her nearer. She responded femininely.
First she hid her face behind her father's legs.
Then she unloosed his trousers and steadied
her approach by the big brim of Orme's
hat. With the other hand she rained blows
upon his face. Bashing her dolls' heads was,
with this baby, a preliminary to loving
them. Finding this one to be flesh and
blood, she crowed with glee, and sat down
suddenly beside him.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham had advanced a step or two
on beholding Marjorie, her face an unexpected
marvel of youth and fairness, against the
dark background of the trees. Then his
eyes fell on David's scowling countenance;
he stopped, and his face flushed.</p>

<p>"Father has sent you a letter," Marjorie
began. "Which of you has got it?" turning
to the boys.</p>

<p>"Not me," said David sullenly, his manner
conveying that no power on earth could
have induced him to touch it.</p>

<p>"Nor me," said Sandy cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Surely you brought it?" Marjorie asked,
a certain severity in her tone. "You,
Ross?" hopefully.</p>

<p>Ross's face had just lighted up with the
intention of making a trio of the charming
duet on the lawn. He was slower than his
more agile brothers&mdash;but sure, and none the
less mischievous, for that his mischief was
better matured beforehand. He opened his
hands to show his innocence, and, murmuring
"Me go find it!" he joined Orme.</p>

<p>Marjorie's eyes were lifted in an appealing
fashion, the prettiness of which she
would have been the last to believe, to the
dark eyes somewhat haughtily questioning
hers.</p>

<p>"My father wrote," she was beginning,
when a skirmish and a squeal made her
stop. Ross was rifling his little brother's
pockets with an air of business. Orme was
wriggling and fighting, and the baby was
kicking and screaming in his defence, a
vivid little vixen.</p>

<p>"Here," said Ross proudly, as having
overturned Orme and left him prostrate, he
held up Mr. Bethune's letter.</p>

<p>Marjorie's colour rose at the aspect of the
dishevelled note. Its appearance, indeed,
was not that of a missive calculated to
appease the anger of an offended man. She
watched a little amusedly the expression of
the long fingers which daintily received and
opened the crumpled paper. Then it struck
her that in the character of suppliants they
were not behaving properly.</p>

<p>She looked at David. His face now wore
an expression of absolute vacuity. She wondered
if by any possibility it would be
taken for penitence. She hoped it might,
as it certainly expressed nothing else. Laying
her hand on his shoulder&mdash;after all, he was
only nine, and could not have done much
mischief, even if he had behaved badly&mdash;Marjorie
gave him a gentle push forward.</p>

<p>"My little brother is sorry," she began,
as the dark eyes, smiling now, were uplifted
from the note.</p>

<p>But David, beating off her hand, said
fiercely, "I'm not!"</p>

<p>"Oh, David!" said Marjorie, helplessly.
"Then, if you aren't, why did we&mdash;you
come?" a sudden passion in her tone.</p>

<p>"Margie! Margie!" called the cheerful
voice of Sandy. And Marjorie turned her
eyes hopefully to the speaker. He, at
least, would not fail her in this emergency&mdash;he
was always ready to say something
nice.</p>

<p>Sandy was staggering towards them laden
with the baby. His cap had fallen off, and
she was alternately thumping his tight
curls and laying her face down upon them
in gurgling delight. This living head, with
its silky adornments, was quite a new sort
of toy in her hitherto child-solitary life.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham made an alarmed step forward.
He expected nothing less than the sudden
destruction of his baby. But Sandy, grasping
her tightly with both sturdy arms, eluded
his outstretched hand and went on to
Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Ain't she a nice baby, Margie? She's a
girl. Don't you wish we'd got a girl 'stead
of on'y boys? Can I take this'n home?" he
demanded, suddenly fixing brilliant blue eyes
on the baby's owner.</p>

<p>"Oh, Sandy, Sandy! are you as artless as
you seem?" thought Marjorie, watching with
sympathy the magnetic change on the
father's face as he looked down at his child.</p>

<p>"I am sorry. I can't spare her," he said
gently, looking kindly at the eager beggar.</p>

<p>"Can't you?" disappointedly; "I should
like her ever so."</p>

<p>"Me, too," cried Orme, standing by with
straddled legs and wide-open eyes fixed on
Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Me yike her ever so," chimed in Ross,
ambling up and joining the group, murmuring,
as no one attended to him, that he would
carry her in his two arms.</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 450px;">
<img src="images/img080.jpg" width="450" height="341" alt="Staggering" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">Sandy was staggering towards them laden with the baby.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In her dark, flashing beauty this baby, with
her vivid face, her quick movements, her
vitality, her curious coquetry of advance and
withdrawal, was a revelation to the little
boys. Only David&mdash;silent and superior&mdash;still
held aloof, till the baby suddenly saw him
and claimed him for another slave.</p>

<p>"Up!&mdash;up!" she called, in the imperious
monosyllables by which she declared her will,
holding out her arms to David and beating
an impatient tattoo on Sandy with her toes.
No boy could have resisted the flattery&mdash;least
of all David, whom his mother often set to
"mind" the babes because he was so good
to them. And David&mdash;a sudden flush and
smile illumining his face&mdash;took her from
Sandy's unwilling clasp.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No apologies were made that day. In
David's arms the baby accompanied her new
friends&mdash;all clamouring, all seeking to amuse&mdash;down
the hill to the gate.</p>

<p>Marjorie and Mr. Pelham followed slowly.
If the man found the young girl interesting,
he was to her equally so. She had
come across no one like him before. He
had come out of a world of which she
knew nothing&mdash;of which, until to-day, she
had never thought. Not many working
people had hitherto come under her notice.</p>

<p>"Have you pictures?" she had asked, in
surprise at a remark.</p>

<p>"A few&mdash;I wish I had shown them to you,
as you care for them."</p>

<p>"But you have altered the old house?"
There was a world of reproach in her
tone.</p>

<p>"Not for the worse, I hope. It has been
most carefully restored."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes&mdash;restored!" said Marjorie slightingly.
The word was an abomination, savouring
of destruction, in Norham.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham smiled. "Come and see some
day," he said. "I should like Mr. Bethune's
opinion. My friend, the architect, wondered
that I had not claimed his counsel."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you? People do."</p>

<p>"I realised my&mdash;presumption," he answered,
pausing a moment for a word.</p>

<p>Marjorie turned to look at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>"My father&mdash;&mdash;" she began; "you are laughing
at us. I know what you mean. We are
old-fashioned, behind the times, prejudiced,
narrow&mdash;I wonder you came."</p>

<p>He laughed. "It was just for that I came.
I wanted my little one to have, a beautiful
home, and all beside that you have said."</p>

<p>"But you, of course, despise old things! Do
you?" she asked&mdash;"even that!"</p>

<p>They had reached in their descent of the
hill an opening in the trees whence across the
field stood out blackly against the luminous
western sky the stately cathedral. Fore-shortened
against the sky, the great length
of the building was not perceptible. But the
twin spires, the great central tower, the dome
of the chapter-house, and the length of the
northern transept, suggested a building raised
for all time, if not for eternity.</p>

<p>"That is old," said Marjorie, a world of possessive
delight in her voice.</p>

<p>"You share your father's love for it?" he
said, turning to look at the face beside him,
its fairness accentuated by the evening glow.</p>

<p>"How do you know? You know my
father?" And a man less acute than this
one would have seen the way straight before
him into the girl's heart.</p>

<p>"Don't you think you can know a man in
his books?" he asked. "Even if I had not
heard him read the paper, I
think I should have understood
by that little book how
he loved the cathedral."</p>

<p>"I did not know you were
that sort," she said slowly, as
into her eyes there crept a
friendliness, which the man,
recognising, found very pleasant
to meet.</p>

<p>"But I am afraid I am not
that sort," he said. "I am ignorant
and he is learned. But I can feel the
fascination of it. And I want my
baby to grow up amongst it all&mdash;amongst
you all," he corrected.
"You remember what Ruskin says
about homes? That passage after
he has described what houses,
homes, should not be, 'tottering,
foundationless shells of splintered
wood and mutilated stone, comfortless,
unhonoured dwellings which
men build in the hope of leaving.'
Instead, I would have our homes
like temples, built to last, and to
be lovely, something God has lent
to us for our life, and that our
children will love." He paused.
"That is the sort of home I want
to make for my little one."</p>

<p>They had reached the iron gate
leading into the road. Sandy, with
an air of possession, drew forth
his key and threw it open, and the
action brought recollection back to
Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Oh!" with a sudden start, "we
came to apologise, and I forgot.
Sandy, give Mr. Pelham his key,
and remember&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sandy came forward, holding out
the key with a twinkle in his
merry eyes. "I 'pologise," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham laughed. "Keep the
key, and come in and see my baby
as you go backwards and forwards;
she has no playfellows."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE BEGINNINGS OF LOVE.</h3>

<p>"Marjorie, I've met the new man."</p>

<p>"What man?" Marjorie, sitting
in the garden, looked up from the
polishing of her poem at her
visitor, a girl of about her own age, the
Dean's only child.</p>

<p>"The man from Blackton. He dined with
us last night. I made father ask him in the
train. Oh&mdash;don't think I did it out of charity,"
she said, laughing. "He was staying at
Oldstead&mdash;you know we've been there. Orme,
you cherub! what cheeks you've got!" and she
caught up the three-year-old and kissed him.</p>

<p>"He'll spoil your grand frock," cautioned
Marjorie. "They've been making mud-pies in
their hovel."</p>

<p>"Pies," said Orme, wriggling down from
Charity's knee, and dragging at her hand;
nor desisting, till she got up to accompany
him.</p>

<p>Marjorie looked after her brilliant friend,
who was adored by all the Bethune children
in turn, until they reached the age of nine;
after which their admiration congealed. Soon,
she turned her thoughts again to her labour.
It was difficult making sonnets, in her busy
life. She had to snatch moments when she
could.</p>

<p>"Of course, 'lone' would rhyme with
'atone,'" she murmured; "but it is so
obvious. Love doesn't want a crowd&mdash;I
gathered that from mother. Have you
done your sonnet, Charity?" as the other
girl ran back and sat down again, Orme
and Ross following in pursuit, as fast as
their fat legs would allow.</p>

<p>"My sonnet? Not I! I've been basking
in the Duchess's smiles and wearing my new
frocks. She asked after you; she didn't
know you'd got back. I put on this new
one to show you, Marjorie."</p>

<p>"You look very silvery and cloudy,"
Marjorie said. "It suits you, but it
wouldn't stand much work."</p>

<p>"Neither should I. Oh, Marjorie&mdash;hateful
word! Don't distil Mrs. Lytchett. I was
forgetting Mr. Pelham. He sings divinely&mdash;a
sort of baritony tenor, that floats, and
melts&mdash;I can't describe it. What stupids
we've all been about him!"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Thinking him so deep down in Blackton
smoke. He knew all the people at Oldstead.
Blackton seems the fashion there, like an
East-End. It was too silly having to be
introduced, when he lives on the other side
of the road. He seemed to know you,
Marjorie."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I went there."</p>

<p>"You went there? To call?"</p>

<p>"To apologise, as usual," laughing; "the
boys had been in mischief."</p>

<p>"Why, he said what jolly boys they were,
and that his baby was quite happy with
them; and he was so glad she should have
some companions. I thought he little knew.'</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;he forgave them."</p>

<p>Her visitor laughed. "Now, Marjorie, don't
be so hoity-toity. Why did you go if you
didn't want to be forgiven?"</p>

<p>"Why? To save father bother." Unconsciously,
the young voice took a pathetic
tone. "Do you think we would have
demeaned ourselves otherwise?"</p>

<p>There was the sound of the clatter of
voices. Marjorie sprang up to try and stop
an excursion into the drawing-room. Her
friend leant back in her chair, and looked
after her.</p>

<p>"If Marjorie were well-dressed," she thought,
"she'd be a beauty. That girl they were
fussing after isn't in with her&mdash;only she's got
clothes; clothes mean so much. Why, Sandy,
what have you got there?"</p>

<p>Sandy panted to her side, both his arms
laden with a baby. She did not appear to
mind her uncomfortable position; but when
deposited upon Charity's lap, bent her brows
in a scowl, as she studied Miss Francklin's
dainty finery.</p>

<p>"It's the baby from 'The Ridges'&mdash;she's got
a name a mile long; we call her Barbe. We
found her, so we brought her. We wanted
a girl down here."</p>

<p>"You don't mean," said Marjorie, overhearing,
and turning to David, "that you've
brought her without leave? Oh, David!"</p>

<p>"She was sittin' in her carriage, all silks
and satins, and we saw the nurse's petticoats
whisk in; so we just ran the pram down
the hill, and left it inside the gate. That
nurse finks a deal too much of herself,"
explained Sandy.</p>

<p>"You'll have to go this very minute and
say where she is," said Marjorie. "Go,
David, both of you&mdash;run!" she urged, remembrance
coming of the father's face as
he looked at his child.</p>

<p>"I'll go with you," Charity exclaimed
good-naturedly, springing up. "Come, boys&mdash;hadn't
we better take her back with us,
Marjorie?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had," said Marjorie. "But
why should you trouble?"</p>

<p>"It's no trouble. I wanted to go to the
Green, and I am ready."</p>

<p>The four disappeared, chattering and laughing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and Marjorie once more applied herself to
her poem. Her eyes rested vaguely on the
flowers before her. Her thoughts would not
come. Instead, came others&mdash;on dress, and
the inequalities of life. Charity looked very
fluffy and soft&mdash;very different her dress was
from Marjorie's green linen. Marjorie looked
down on her skirts disparagingly, not exactly
envying the soft summer dress of her friend,
but seeing the contrast. Charity could have
everything she wanted. Money was never
lacking, and she had an indulgent father.
Marjorie's father&mdash;here the girl's face took
on a tender look&mdash;had no money to spare.
The two boys at Winchester cost so much,
and there were the others to follow. But
not for a moment would Marjorie have
parted with one of them&mdash;pervasive, noisy,
unsettling, costly, too, though they were.
Her thoughts ran on, finishing at last with:
"You've got to face facts. Charity is
Charity, by herself. And I am I, one of
seven. I had better brush my frock."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/img083.jpg" width="350" height="411" alt="Bishop" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">The Bishop passed on to greet Marjorie.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Precincts, as they gradually thawed
to the new-comer, reprobated his choice of
companions for his little daughter.</p>

<p>"The Bethune boys are the last you
should encourage," said Mrs. Lytchett to him,
the night he first dined at the Palace.
"They've had no bringing up. Their father
doesn't look after them, and their mother
can't, poor thing. Marjorie is a spitfire, and
has only just left off mischief herself&mdash;if she
has. There's nothing they're not capable of&mdash;nothing!"</p>

<p>"Your little girl is a delight to the
Bethune boys," the Bishop said in his kind
tones, later. "They brought her to see me
this morning. Oh! they won't do her any
harm, just the contrary," in reply to an
anxious question, "if they aren't led away by
their adventurous spirits. They are honest,
plucky boys, and chivalric in a peculiar
manner. And their sister&mdash;ah! there she is!"</p>

<p>The Bishop passed on to greet Marjorie,
without the meed of praise he was on the
point of bestowing; but Mr. Pelham, watching
them, gathered that Marjorie was a favourite.
She was looking well, distinguished, in her
youthful, immature way, in a graceful, soft
dress, whose clinging folds suited her height
and slimness. Charity's pink
prettiness, aided by every careful
detail of dress and ornament,
faded to nothing beside her.
Marjorie had not been dining,
but had come in through the
conservatory, her wrap over her
arm. There was a look of grave
purity and freshness about her,
that sort of expectancy on a
young face which gives a beholder
a pang, knowing how
soon it will be disturbed by the
wisdom and cares of the world.
But the beholder to-night
thought it beautiful. It drew
him to her, more than any
mere beauty would have done.
"Just like that"&mdash;the unspoken
wish arose in his heart&mdash;"may
my little one grow up!" Another
thought followed, stabbing him
for a moment with a pang.</p>

<p>He was roused by Charity's
soft blandishments.</p>

<p>"Will you come and sing with
me, Mr. Pelham? Mrs. Lytchett
wants some music. It is such a
comfort to have another good
tenor, instead of only Mr. Warde.
That is he," she said softly, directing
his glance to a man who
had just joined the Bishop and
Marjorie.</p>

<p>"Who is he?" he asked, something
in the manner of the lingering handshake,
some air of possession, striking coldly
on Mr. Pelham.</p>

<p>"One of the minor canons. He is very
well off and, as you see, good-looking, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
fancies himself a little." Charity laughed
lightly. "Also," lowering her voice, "he is
said to fancy Marjorie. I believe it is an
understood thing. He wanted her a year
ago, but she was only seventeen. She is a
year younger than I am, but you wouldn't
think it, would you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Pelham, as he turned with Charity to
the piano, felt a sudden wrath at the man&mdash;a
man much older than himself&mdash;who had
the insolence to pretend to claim that slim
girl.</p>

<p>A little later he made his way to the
sofa, where Marjorie was sitting with Mrs.
Lytchett. That lady, full of kindliness to
Marjorie, fully intending to chaperon her
during the winter to all the festivities, yet
liked to remind her pretty frequently of her,
as yet, unintroduced and unimportant condition.
The skirmishes between them were
hot; and Marjorie had just flashed out,
"After all, mother has her wits, even if she
has to lie on her sofa," when Mr. Pelham
said:</p>

<p>"The Bishop has asked me to persuade Miss
Bethune to play to us."</p>

<p>"Yes, Marjorie, go and play one of your
little pieces," Mrs. Lytchett said, dismissing
Marjorie and her flash of temper as she would
have sent off a child.</p>

<p>Marjorie got up immediately.</p>

<p>"No, thank you," she said, sitting down
before the piano, and smiling up at Mr. Pelham
standing beside her. "My little pieces are
here," lifting slightly the slender hands resting
on her knee.</p>

<p>Wondering what this girl could have to say
in such a language, unwilling to hear anything
crude or jarring that should spoil the perfection
of simplicity he was beginning to
see in her, Mr. Pelham moved aside, his
eyes resting disappointedly on her bent head.
She raised her hands, and struck the opening
notes.</p>

<p>The Bishop sank down into a large chair
near, with a soft sigh. The buzz of conversation
slowly died away. A delicate melody,
in some unaccustomed minor mode, stole
through the vaulted room, and Mr. Pelham
drew a breath of relief. He need not have
feared. There was nothing crude or jarring
here.</p>

<p>After a few minutes her hands fell, with
the lingering soft repetition of an unfinished
phrase, and Marjorie lifted her eyes, liquid
and dreamy with the thoughts that filled
her mind. They met a look from dark unfamiliar
eyes, never again through all her life
to seem to her as the eyes of a stranger.
They held her own, fascinated, arrested,
almost like a voice speaking through the
silence.</p>

<p>Her lips parted, as with a soft little sigh,
her eyes fell.</p>

</div>

<p>"Is that all?" the Bishop asked, disappointedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is all."</p>

<p>Antony Pelham's heart, as he walked up
the hill in the moonlight, was full. He was
only twenty-eight, and desperately lonely,
after the year of brightness and delight he
had shared with his young wife. Marjorie
reminded him of her in some strangely
familiar way&mdash;in her simplicity, her immaturity,
her withdrawals. He turned to
look at the cathedral, shining white in the
moonlight, remembering that she had stood
there with him, and that their talk had
been about a home.</p>

<p>"I will win her," he said, as he turned, and
set his face to climb the hill.</p>

<h2>A NEW CREATION</h2>

<p class="center">By The Rev W.W. Tulloch, D.D.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">"In Christ&mdash;a new creature."&mdash;<span class="smcap">2 Corinthians v. 17.</span></p></blockquote>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/img085b.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="147" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">I fancy that we have
all felt the
need of  a
change of
air, of life, of
our physical
surroundings,
our
mental and
moral environment;
and we have
experienced
the good
that such a
change has
done us. We
have toiled
on through
the bad weather, the hard work, the
much worry of a long winter; or we
have been kept at our post and laboured
listlessly through a hot and oppressive
summer. The wheels of life have dragged
slowly. We have felt below par. Everything
has been more or less a trouble to
us. The routine of daily duty has become
dismally monotonous. The zest has
departed. Our very sleep is not refreshing.
We lie down with our weariness
and trouble about us and in us, and
when we awaken we are still surrounded
and dominated by it. The burden seems
no lighter for our repose. No new
strength seems to have been gained to
face the calls of the new day&mdash;a day
which it is a trouble even to think
about.</p>
</div>

<p>Well, we are ordered a change, or,
driven by our instincts, we seek one, or
the blessed holiday season comes round
at last. We go away, and in fresh air,
in a change of occupation, amid new
interests and associations, we begin to
feel quite different. The old lassitude
and weariness have passed away. We
have not been long in our changed place
of abode, when we begin to say to ourselves
and to write home that we feel
quite new persons&mdash;a different man, a
different woman. And when we return
our very appearance, our talk, the whole
attitude in which we regard life, the
eagerness with which we take up the old
task, tell to all who are interested in us
how much improved we are, how much
healthier and better we look. More to
the purpose, we ourselves feel better in
every way. The change has done us ever
so much good. In it we have found our
old self and yet a new self, and we rejoice
and are glad.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar experience often
comes to us after reading some book
which has influenced us strongly. It
has opened to us a longer vista and a
higher reach of life. It has given to
us new views, new ideas, new aspirations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and made us live with a higher ideal
before us. "It has made a new man of
me," we say. Old things have passed
away. Or we have come under the influence
of some pure love, some self-sacrificing
devotion, such as made the late
Professor Tyndall say in writing of his
wife to a friend that she had given him
quite a new idea as to the possibilities of
human nature. Or in daily association
with some active brain, some large-hearted
companion, we have formed at
once new motives and new interests. All
things have become new.</p>

<p>Or, again, we have found a new vocation.
The consciousness of the possession
of higher powers, of perhaps our real
powers, has come to us. We have discovered
that we have been endowed
with the possession of some gift of
which we were not aware. Some
power has been lying dormant. It has
now been awakened, and upon the very
threshold of what we feel must now be
a better and a higher life, we realise
that we are new creatures.</p>

<p>I was lately reading the life of a famous
singer, Jenny Lind, "the Swedish Nightingale,"
as she was called. She had been
singing in public for some time, but she
had only been feeling her wings, as the
saying goes. But on a certain day there
came the moment of moments. "I got
up that morning one creature," she herself
often said; "I went to bed another
creature. I had found my power." And
all through her life she kept that day
with a religious solemnity. She would
ask to have herself remembered on it
with prayers. She treated it as a second
birthday. And rightly, for on that day
she awoke to herself. She became
artistically alive. She felt the inspiration
and won the sway she now knew
she was given to hold. And this consciousness
was not merely the recognition
that she was singing better than ever.
It was more of the nature of a new fact
in her life, a disclosure, a revelation. "It
was a step," says her biographer, "into a
new world of dominion. She knew at
last where it was that she stood and
what she was to do upon the earth. She
learned something of her mission. For
to her religious mind the discovery of
a gift was the discovery of a mission.
She saw the responsibility with which
she was charged, through the mere
possession of such a power over men."
The singer with the gift of God&mdash;that
was what she became on that evening.
She became a new creature.</p>

<p>Well, all these are only illustrations
of the greatest truth in the world&mdash;that
in Christ we may all become new creatures
or a new creation.</p>

<p>We are prone by nature to do what
is wrong rather than what is right; we
are born with passions wild and strong,
and early give the reins to evil desires.
By the strength of our animal propensities
we are often carried to ruin unless we are
arrested in our headlong and miserable
career. Sometimes&mdash;nay, thank God, often&mdash;we
are thus arrested. For a time, the
voice of conscience may have been hushed.
Our heart is cold and dead, and there is
no spring of life in it at all. But something
happens. We are led to think.
We come to see the evil of our ways,
the ruin that we are bringing on others
as well as ourselves&mdash;on the wife whom
we swore to love and cherish, the children
whom we are neglecting, perhaps starving.</p>

<p>And then, all at once, it is borne in upon
us that we must change our life's course.
A bolt from heaven descends on us in the
shape of some punishment or affliction.
Our darkness and distress are revealed
to us.</p>

<p>We seek the only refuge for the sinner.
We flee to Christ, as the belated and
weary traveller would flee to a hiding-place
from the wind, a refuge from the
storm, a covert from the tempest, the
shadow of a great rock in a weary land.
We become converted. In Christ we
become a new creation. Oh, happy is it
when we do so! Appalling and terrible it
is when we do not. How sad and awful is
the fate of one given over to the slavery,
the bondage, the tyranny of some wicked
habit! Unless such an one is visited by
the grace of God, unless the heinousness
of his guilt is brought home to him,
unless divine light strikes in upon his
darkened life, he will sink deeper and
deeper into degradation, until, perhaps,
he is driven to self-destruction like one
of whom I lately read, and who left
these terribly touching words behind him.
"I am now about to finish a revolting,
cruel, and wretched existence by an act
of my own. I have broken every law of
God and man, and can only hope that
my memory will rot in the minds of all
who knew me. Drink has brought me
to this fearful end. I am dying hopeless,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
friendless, penniless and an outcast." And
it might have been so different! Oh, that
all who are giving way to any sin would
listen to these terrible words of warning,
that they would close at once with
Christ's offer to make their lives different,
to make them new creatures&mdash;once
more fresh and fair creatures of God,
that the old man with his corrupt affections
and desires,
be put off, and
the new man in
Christ Jesus be
put on, that they
would be in
Christ!</p>

<p>To be in Christ&mdash;you
know what
is meant by that.
You are in Christ
if you are living
in and by His
Spirit; if you are
breathing it into
your life; giving
it forth again, if
your life is engrafted
on His
life as a branch
is engrafted upon
a tree. He is the
Vine; we ought
to be as the
branches which
thus derive their
vitality, their
beauty, their
power of bearing
leaf and fruit from the tree. The same
soil nourishes it; the same dews feed
it; the same breezes fan it. So we
ought to have our life fed through
Christ from God. If we are in Christ,
we shall have the same hatred of sin as
He had. We shall be removing ourselves
further from evil; we shall ever be getting
more like Christ, ever increasing in personal
holiness and helpfulness to others,
ever also willing to accept whatever He
sends us, subordinating our weak, wayward
wills to His holy and perfect will.
If we let these words of charm, "In
Christ," be written over our lives, we shall
feel the old fetters fall off, the old unhappiness
disappear, the old insubordination
cease to assert itself.</p>

</div>

<p>We shall hardly know ourselves, the joy
of the new life is so great. It is a joy,
too, which we cannot keep to ourselves;
we wish others to share our happy experience.
We are constrained to wish
this by the new and imperial impulse by
which we are dominated. Because we
carry heaven in our hearts we wish that
others should do so, too. We look upon
the sinner as upon some streamlet of
water which is dwindling away day by
day and will soon be dried up and the
rocky channel left
bare. Why? Because
it is cut off
from the fountain
head, from
the source away
up in the hills
near God's sky.
And what we
wish to do is to
open the connection
between the
two, so that the
stream may be
fed and do what
it is intended to
do&mdash;flow along in
full volume, making
melody as it
goes and fertilising
the region
through which it
passes. In Christ,
we are like the
stream connected
with its source:
like it, we live
melodious days
and carry music
to others. Or look at that branch separated
from its parent stem; it is withering, it
is dying. Again, a planet cut off from the
central force and power&mdash;the sun&mdash;rushes
through the dark night and is lost. So&mdash;if
we be not in Christ, if we be separated
from the true fountain, the living root,
the centrifugal force&mdash;we shrivel up, we
wither, we go to ruin here and hereafter,
we die to all that makes existence tolerable
and of value; and it might have
been so different!</p>

<p>Shall we for the future, if need be, try
to make life different to ourselves and
others?</p>

<p>Then, if any of us become new creatures,
the fact is at once recognised. People
ask&mdash;What has come to So-and-so?
His very appearance is changed; his
gait, everything about him is altered
for the better. He is regularly at his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
work and in his place in church. He has
a pleasant smile and a kind word for
everybody. His wife, who used often to
look dull and unhappy, is now bright
and cheerful. His children are better
dressed than they were; they are more
frank and free with him; they take his
hand; they go to meet him when he
comes home; they consult him about
their little joys and sorrows. He is altogether
quite different. What has come
over him? Oh, the explanation is a
very simple one: he has ceased to do
evil, he has learned to do well. He has
left some course of sin; he is following
after a life of holiness. He has left the
service of a bad master&mdash;the worst of
all masters; he is now serving a new
master&mdash;the best of masters. He has
made the friendship of the best of
friends; Christ is his master, his friend,
his example. He is in Christ. That is
the reason of the change, of the new
creation. That is the reason of the
sunshine he carries about with him, and
which he scatters on others. He is like
Christ Himself, for all true Christians
carry Christ with them, wherever they
go; just as every leaf we take off some
plants, put into soil, will become a plant
exactly like the parent stem from which
it is taken, so the Christ-life in a man,
if it be genuine, will reproduce its source
and origin. The least tiny speck of
musk, carry it where you may, diffuses
the same kind of fragrance as the plant
from which it came. So lives thus hid in
Christ with God will be redolent of Him
in all places and at all times.</p>

<p>Let us, then, if we would be happy in
our present lives&mdash;happy in the memories
we leave behind us&mdash;happy in the great
Hereafter&mdash;see that we are now in Christ,
that we now know the glory and joy of
feeling a new creature. It is a great
joy to think that old things have passed
away, that all things have become new.
Then the very earth upon which we live
will have a new beauty for us. We shall
look upon it as the creation of our
Heavenly Father, as the place in which
we are to work for Him, making our little
corner of it better, happier, more blessed
than we found it. Then, too, we shall
regard our fellow-men and women quite
differently. We find that they are related
to us in new ways and with holier, more
sacred ties; they are our veritable brothers
and sisters in Christ Jesus. We can do
them no harm, injure them in no way;
rather shall we find it to be our highest
duty and privilege to be helpful to them.
Then, too, will pain and sorrow assume a
different and new aspect. They cease to
be altogether evils; they are seen to be
blessings in disguise&mdash;crosses, indeed, but
only sent to bring us nearer to God and
to Christ; bitter medicine, indeed, but
needed for our spiritual health.</p>

<p>Lastly, death itself, the old foe of the
human race, as he is supposed by many
to be, takes a new form. The awful and
awesome shroud in which he seems
to be enveloped falls off, and what we
recognise is not the spectral skeleton with
the hollow eyes coming to consign us to
darkness and to death, but a radiant
angel, a sweet, blessed messenger from
the Father, bidding us come with him to
our happy and eternal Home to meet our
loved and lost, to be in Christ and with
Christ for ever, with no chance any more
of breaking off from Him or losing Him.
And, recognising this, we shall go with
him with the eagerness of a child to
begin a new life, to enter upon a higher
existence, to do nobler work with a more
untiring zeal and energy, to love with
a greater love; and as we stand for a
moment to look back upon our earthly
life, in the freshness of the Eternal Morning,
in the beauty of our new Home, we
shall realise that in Christ's Heaven,
which through His great mercy and
sacrifice we have reached, we are to be
new creatures for evermore.</p>

<h2>Donkey
Boy
to the
Queen.</h2>

<p class="center">A True Incident. By Alfred T. Story.</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/img089b.jpg" alt="O" width="100" height="100" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">One dull though calm afternoon,
when the century
was younger by nearly
half its years than it
is to-day, two bright-faced,
handsome boys,
dressed in Highland
costume, were quietly
fishing in a mountain stream, when they
were disturbed in their contemplative
pastime by the piteous cries of a dog.
Barely had they time to look round before
a poor, miserable little cur ran past them,
followed by an irate youth brandishing
a stout cudgel. As the dog turned and
cowered behind their creel, and seemed
to crave their protection, the elder of the
brothers&mdash;for such they were&mdash;stepped
between the poor brute and its tormentor,
asking the latter what the dog had done
that it should be so ill-treated.</p>
</div>

<p>Said the lad gruffly, resenting the boys'
interference:</p>

<p>"What's it to ye? She's ma dug, an'
I'll do what I like wi' her."</p>

<p>"You shan't hit her with that stick,"
replied the sturdy youth, who, though
tall for his age, was not so thick-set as
his opponent, and was evidently a couple
of years his junior.</p>

<p>"Mebbe I will, mebbe I willna," returned
the lad, who, though not ill-looking,
was poorly clad, and, for the time
being, ugly with passion. "But I'll hae
th' dug," and with the word he tried to
push past the obstructer. A scuffle ensued,
in which the younger boy wrested
the cudgel from the dog's tormentor,
but, as his share, received a blow on the
nose which brought blood.</p>

<p>"Gie me ta stick," said the owner of the
dog, surprised that he had so far underrated
his antagonist.</p>

<p>The latter's answer was to cast it into
the stream.</p>

<p>This still more astonished the peasant
lad, who seemed as though he would again
fall upon his antagonist. But there was
something about the youth's straight,
well-knit figure, his handsome face, and
flashing eye that caused him to reflect;
whereupon he lowered his fists, which had
risen to the bravado of attack, and, in a
less defiant tone, said:</p>

<p>"Weel, let me hae Meg, an' I'll say
naethin' aboot ta stick."</p>

<p>"Promise me not to beat her then."</p>

<p>The young callant gave the required
undertaking, and the next minute he had
the shrinking little animal in his arms and
was walking away with it the way he had
come. But, turning round when he had
gone a few rods, he saw the youth who
had withstood him bending over the
stream, laving his face in the cool water.</p>

<p>Now, for the first time, Tam, as he was
called, noticed something about the boys
which in his anger he had failed to mark.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
It was not their dress&mdash;though that betokened
rank above the common; it was
something more intimate than that; something
in the air, in the manner, of them
which made him uneasy in his mind, and
caused him to steal home with lagging
gait and eyes that sought the ground.</p>

<p>His home was a little bracken-thatched
one-storey cottage, or hut, with stone
walls, planted in a green oasis of a few
yards square, amid a wilderness of rock
and shingle, overgrown with moss and
heather and other rough vegetation, from
which a few stray sheep and stunted
cattle gathered a scanty subsistence.
These were Tam's charge. For not far
from the little two-roomed cot which he
called his home were other huts like it,
inhabited by poor, hard-working people
like his grandparents, each having a
few sheep, or a cow or two, and one or
another a donkey or wild-looking Highland
pony; and he, having to look after
his grandfather's little stock, was paid a
trifle by the others to tend theirs too.</p>

<p>Tam Jamison had done this since he was
five, at which age he was left an orphan by
the death of his mother, who died broken-hearted
at the loss of her husband, fighting
in a distant land against Britain's foes.</p>

<p>He was now twelve; and though he
loved the braes and the mountain streams,
he was beginning to chafe at his narrow
life, wanting to be off now with the
drovers, now with the sportsmen and
gillies, or the coachmen who drove their
teams daily in the season past his grandfather's
croft. It was a hard task for
the old folks, Donal and Yetta Jamison,
to retain him at home, impossible to
make him content. They did their best
to keep him under control; but it was
chiefly done by coaxing, a good deal by
petting. This in the end did not lighten
their task. Every day Tam became more
wayward and difficult; every other day
there were complaints of his negligence
on the one hand, of his mischief on the
other; and then, to cap all, it came to
the old people's ears that their Tam&mdash;it
could be no other&mdash;had dared to raise his
fist against one of the princes of the
blood, no less than the Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>That very evening the news was all over
the country-side. The next morning there
was such a hubbub as never was heard.
Everybody said Tam would certainly be
sent to jail, if no worse thing befell him.
Tam, braving the thing out, said he
"didna mind"; but the old folks, greatly
caring, put on their Sunday best, and set
out to walk to Braemar to see and intercede
with the Queen on the boy's behalf.
They found her not at home, and so had
their long trudge for nothing. However,
one of the domestics drew from them what
their business was; and the next day a
little lady, very plainly dressed, riding on
a wee, shaggy pony, stopped at the door,
and, being helped to dismount by a man
who was with her, entered the hut and
asked for Tam's grandparents.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/img090.jpg" width="250" height="432" alt="shaggy" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">A little lady on a shaggy pony
stopped at the door.</p></div>
</div>

<p>They were not afraid of the little lady,
because she looked so good and kind, and
spoke so gently, but when they discovered
that she was from Braemar, and that
it was to learn all about Tam that she
had come, they were almost tremblingly
anxious. Thinking that the Queen had
sent her, they apologised very humbly for
the boy's misbehaviour, saying it did not
arise from any badness in him so much as
from wilfulness and daring. They hoped
the Queen wouldna be severe on the
laddie; he was little more than a child,
and though masterful and not to be said,
he had not a bad heart. It was partly
their fault, no doubt, as Tam, having no
parents, had been left to them very
young, and they, perhaps, had spoiled
him just a little.</p>

<p>So the old folks went on, the tears often
in their eyes.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the good lady from
Braemar had made herself acquainted
with all the circumstances of Tam's birth
and rearing, had heard the catalogue of
his faults and shortcomings, and been
posted as to his restlessness and discontent.
It was a long and interesting human
inventory, wound up with the declaration,
tearfully attested by both Donal and
Yetta, that "he wasna sae bad as wilfu'";
albeit they confessed to being greatly
afraid, if he went away from them, as
he wished, lest his masterfulness should
lead him into evil ways.</p>

<p>"And where is this masterful one, this
Tam?" asked the Lady of Braemar. "One
would like to see him."</p>

<p>Tam, however, could nowhere be found.
The old man looked up and down for him,
neighbours joined in the search; but it
was only too plain that Tam had hidden
himself away somewhere.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Lady, at length, "I
cannot tarry any longer. But the boy
cannot be far away; so when he is found
bring him to Braemar, and we will see
what can be done."</p>

<p>Donal and Yetta promised that such
should be their care, and, as a last word,
ere the Lady rode away, they begged that
she would intercede on Tarn's behalf "wi'
the gude and gracious Queen."</p>

<p>The Lady promised to do her utmost,
and so departed.</p>

<p>The next day, the "sodger's laddie," as
Tam was called, having in the meanwhile
been found, the grey-headed old crofter
and his wife, both of them bent with toil
and drooping with care, once more made
their way over the hills to Braemar; Tam,
downhearted, demure, and in his Sabbath
claes, padding the turf by their side.</p>

<p>Arrived at their destination, Tam hung
a low head; for in front of the house
was congregated a little party, chiefly of
children, preparing to set out for a ride;
among the number being the two young
gentlemen whom he knew.</p>

<p>The elder of them, the Prince of Wales,
at once recognising his antagonist of three
days ago, stepped up to him and said,
with a frank and kindly smile:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-morning, Tam! You haven't forgotten
me, have you?"</p>

<p>Tam uttered a barely audible "Nae."</p>

<p>"And you hold no grudge against me
for throwing your stick in the river, do
you?"</p>

<p>Another demure "Nae" found its way
between Tam's half-closed teeth; but this
time he allowed his blue eyes to meet the
young Prince's in a surprised gaze.</p>

<p>"Then let us shake hands and be
friends," said the Prince.</p>

<p>Tam extended his brown paw, and they
clasped in token of mutual goodwill.</p>

<p>The little scene transacted itself almost
as quickly as it can be read&mdash;so quickly,
indeed, that Tam's grandparents witnessed
it in mute astonishment; and
before they had recovered their self-possession,
the Lady who had called at the
hut on Tam's account issued from the
house, looking much as she had done the
previous day, with the exception that a
broad-brimmed straw hat covered her
head in place of a sun-bonnet.</p>

<p>"So you found the little runagate, did
you?" said she, addressing the old folks.</p>

<p>"Yes, madam," replied Donal. "Mister
Fargus found him at night in a cave in
the birch-wood above the burn."</p>

<p>"What made you run away, Tam?"
said the Lady, turning to the youth.</p>

<p>Tam was silent.</p>

<p>"Tell me. You need not be afraid."</p>

<p>"I thought mebbe I had hurt him"&mdash;with
a nod in the direction of the Prince.</p>

<p>"Oh, you didn't hurt me! You only
brought a little of the red juice out of
my nose, and that can hurt nobody,"
said the Heir-Apparent.</p>

<p>Prince Alfred, who was standing by,
smiled at his brother's sally, as did also
the Lady in the straw hat.</p>

<p>Tam laughed outright. He had never
heard or known of a bleeding nose being
treated so lightly, and at the same time
so funnily. His poor grandparents, however,
were shocked at his levity, and
Yetta gave him a vigorous nudge to
recall him to a due sense of his position.</p>

<p>"If you like," said the Prince, "I'll
give you one of my sticks in place of the
one I threw away," adding, with nice
diplomacy, "but I can tell you it's too
proud a stick to hit a dog."</p>

<p>Tam smiled, and said he would not use
it in that way.</p>

<p>"And I think we must ask you to
promise not to think of ever running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
away from your grandparents," said the
Lady.</p>

<p>That seemed to strike Tam as a large
order.</p>

<p>"I wouldna like to bide on the croft
when I get bigger."</p>

<p>"Why, what do
you wish to be
when you grow
bigger?"</p>

<p>"I want to be
a soldier, like my
father."</p>

<p>Yetta drew a
pained breath;
Donal's lips
twitched.</p>

<p>"You would not
like him to go for
a soldier?" queried
the Lady.</p>

<p>"Baith my sons
focht and deed for
their kintra," said
Donal.</p>

<p>"And you would
like to keep your
grandson to comfort
you in your
old age?"</p>

<p>The old folks
bowed; their
trembling lips
could hardly frame an audible "Yes."</p>

<p>"It is quite natural. You hear that,
Tam? You would not like to go away
to the wars, as your father and your
uncle did, and be killed, and so grieve
your poor grandparents."</p>

<p>"I dinna want to grieve 'em," replied
Tam. "But I'd like to be a soldier and
fight for the Queen."</p>

<p>At this answer there was more than one
moistened eyelid in the little group,
whereof Tam, for the time being, constituted
the central figure.</p>

<p>After a brief pause, his interlocutor
continued:</p>

<p>"But, my boy, there are other ways
of serving the Queen than by becoming
a soldier&mdash;many other ways."</p>

<p>That was a new aspect of things to the
boy, and his eyes, when he lifted them up
to meet the Lady's, contained each a
large note of interrogation.</p>

<p>"For instance," she continued, "the
Queen wants a donkey-boy now, to attend
her or the children when they drive
about in their little phaeton." The boy's
eyes brightened, then fell.</p>

<p>"You think the care of a donkey beneath
you?"</p>

<div class="figcenter bord" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/img092.jpg" width="350" height="302" alt="shake" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center">"Then let us shake hands," said the Prince.</p></div>
</div>

<p>"Nae, but I doubt that the Queen
wouldna hae me to be her donkey-boy."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"'Cos I hae nae bin a donkey-boy, an'
I might do things wrang."</p>

<p>"But you could learn&mdash;everybody has to
learn. And if you did your best there
could not be much fault-finding."</p>

<p>"I'd do my best."</p>

<p>"Nobody could say better than that,"
replied the Lady.</p>

<p>"Ah, if your leddyship," faltered Yetta,
"could get her Majesty to mek' him her
donkey-boy, or to 'point him to any sic
position, he would still be near to us,
an' a comfort in our old age."</p>

<p>"Ay, an' he would think nae mair o'
running away," added Donal.</p>

<p>"You may be sure the matter will be
taken into her earnest consideration," said
the Lady. "And now, after you have had
some refreshment, which I will ask them
to give you, you had better go home,
and in the course of a few days you will
doubtless hear further."</p>

<h2>TEMPERANCE NOTES AND NEWS.</h2>

<p class="center">By a Leading Temperance Advocate.</p>


<p>No apology is
needed
for opening
a temperance
department
in <span class="smcap">The
Quiver</span>, for in
the story of the
temperance reformation
the
name of John
Cassell will assuredly
always
hold an honoured
place. At the
time when he
was enlisted in
the ranks&mdash;1835&mdash;as
a youth of
seventeen, the
movement had
few friends and many opponents. Having
once signed the "teetotal pledge," Cassell
never deserted, but, on the contrary, became
one of the most persuasive advocates the
cause has ever had. He itinerated through
the length and breadth of the land, and,
under the name of "The Manchester Carpenter,"
gained a large number of adherents,
some of whom subsequently achieved great
reputations as temperance leaders. Even
before Cassell had settled down in London
as a publisher, he had learnt to value the
printing press as an aid to temperance work,
and not a few of the pamphlets, tracts, and
broadsheets which played such an important
part in the early days of the propaganda,
owed their origin to his enterprising initiative.
By-and-by he was in a position to command
his own printing machines, and as early as
March, 1846, he launched the <cite>Teetotal Times
and Monthly Temperance Messenger</cite>, which
was followed in July, 1848, by the <cite>Standard
of Freedom</cite>, of which a temperance column
was a leading feature. Anyone who takes
the trouble to look over these early publications
cannot fail to be struck by the
comprehensive and statesmanlike grip of the
drink difficulty which they present. It
was to John Cassell that Richard Cobden
wrote in 1849:&mdash;"I don't know how it is
that I have never made the plunge and
joined the teetotallers. Nobody has more
faith than I in the truth of your doctrine,
both from a physical and moral point of
view, for the more work I have had to do
the more I have resorted to the pump and
the teapot. As for the moral bearings of
the question, it is scarcely an exaggeration
to say that all other reforms together would
fail to confer as great blessings upon the
masses as that of weaning them from intoxicating
drinks." Cassell passed away at the
early age of forty-eight, on April 2nd, 1865,
on the same day as Cobden himself, whose
friendship he had enjoyed for nearly twenty
years.</p>

<h4>COMING EVENTS.</h4>

<p>Among the important events fixed for this
month may be named two meetings convened
by the National Temperance League for
November 2nd, in Oxford, to be addressed by
His Grace the Archbishop of Canterbury
and Professor Victor Horsley, F.R.S., the
distinguished surgeon. One meeting is
specially intended for undergraduates, while
the other will be open to the townsfolk.
On November 4th by permission of the Lord
Mayor of London, the Mansion House will
extend its hospitality to the Police Court
Mission of the C.E.T.S., and Bishops, Members
of Parliament, and Police Court Magistrates
will plead the cause of this deserving charity.
On November 27th the Nonconformist Churches
will observe their annual Temperance Sunday,
and on November 30th a function anticipated
with keen interest,
the first Lees-Raper
Memorial Lecture
will take place in
the Church House,
Westminster.</p>

<h4>SUNDAY CLOSING.</h4>


<p>Thanks to the
munificent generosity
of Mr. Arnold
F. Hills, who has
promised a donation
of &#163;5,000,
conditional upon
temperance friends
making up another
&#163;5,000, a determined
effort is to
be made to press
forward the Sunday Closing question in view
of the reassembling of Parliament early in the
new year. The whole-hearted ardour and enthusiasm
which have marked Mr. Hills' temperance
labours during the past ten years
have made his name a household word. He
started out with the settled conviction that
the greatest need of the time was the union of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the temperance forces; and in the face of
difficulties and obstacles which would have disheartened
ninety-nine men out of a hundred,
he has ceaselessly concentrated his energies
to this end. The United Temperance Council,
with its network of county councils and district
councils throughout the United Kingdom,
is the creation of his active brain; while the
Temperance Parliament, which has given an
opportunity to all the friends of temperance
legislation to discuss their various projects,
is another child of Mr. Hills' parentage.</p>


<h4> IRISH EXAMPLE.</h4>

<p>Visitors to Belfast cannot pass along the
streets of this thriving, go-ahead city without
being brought face to face with the practical
efforts of the Irish Temperance League to
counteract the public-houses. The League has
set up nearly twenty attractive coffee stands
in various parts of the town, and these do a
very large business and are extremely popular.
The movement was commenced in 1874,
the first stand being opened on a site
granted by the Harbour Commissioners, for a
nominal rent, near to the berths of the cross-Channel
steamers. As many as 10,000 persons
have patronised the stands in one day. The
hours of opening and closing are regulated according
to the locality. No intoxicating liquors
are allowed to be consumed on the premises;
the best of food is provided; the most
scrupulous cleanliness
is observed;
and no bills of
any kind are exhibited,
or anything
likely to jar
on the religious or
political feelings
of the customers.</p>

<h4>THE LEES-RAPER
MEMORIAL.</h4>

<p>It will be a long
time before temperance
folk will
forget the shock
which was occasioned
in May,
1897, by the sudden
deaths within ten days of each other, of
Dr. Lees and Mr. J. H. Raper. These two
devoted workers were known in both hemispheres,
and it would be impossible in such
limited space to give an adequate appreciation
of their marvellous gifts. Dr. F. R. Lees was
ever a fighter. From his boyhood up to his
honoured old age he was always eager for the
fray. As a keen controversialist he was
literally without a rival. The winning personality
of James Hayes Raper carried all
before it. He was unquestionably a platform
king. Nothing could be more charming than
the extraordinary facility with which he rapidly
placed himself in touch with an audience; and
he possessed in a rare degree the gift of being
able to make an acceptable "last speech" in a
programme. The Committee charged with the
promotion of a memorial to these temperance
worthies is to be congratulated upon having
raised nearly &#163;1,700. Of this amount, &#163;1,500
has been invested in a terminable annuity for
a period of twenty years. A Lees-Raper lectureship
has been founded, and, as already
stated, the inaugural lecture will be given by
Dean Farrar,
of Canterbury,
at the
Church House,
Westminster,
on November
30th. The
Archbishop of
Canterbury
will preside,
and the Dean
has chosen as
his theme
"Temperance
Reform as Required
by
Righteousness
and Patriotism."</p>

<h2>The HOUSE BEAUTIFUL</h2>

<p class="center">By Orman Cooper, Author of "We Wives," Etc.</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/img096b.jpg" alt="I" width="100" height="124" class="cap" />
<p class="cap_1">"In the fields of taste it is
always much easier to
point out paths which
should be avoided
than to indicate the
road which leads to
excellence."</p>
</div>

<p>Such are the words
of a well-known artist
of the present day. I
feel them to be true as
I begin this paper on
the House Beautiful.
Taste differs so widely that it would be
futile to try to set up a positive standard
of beauty. Furniture has its fashions, too,
though they change but slowly. So we can
only lay down broad general rules with
regard to the plenishment of our homes.
We cannot insist on detail.</p>

<p>There is no single point on which a gentlewoman
is more jealous of disparagement than
the question of taste. Yet it is a lamentable
fact that this very quality is often&mdash;I may
say generally&mdash;deficient even amongst the
most cultured classes. The bubble of fashion
is blown in our drawing-rooms just as surely
and even more foolishly than elsewhere. Individuality
is seldom seen.</p>

<p>In order to have lovely homes inside four
commonplace walls we must remember that
<em>simplicity</em> is one true element of beauty.
The best and most picturesque furniture of
all ages has been simple in general form.
Next, good design is always compatible with
sturdy service, and can accommodate itself
to the most fastidious notions of convenience.
Thirdly, every article of manufacture to be
really beautiful should indicate by its general
design the purpose to which it will be
applied. In other words, shams and make-believes
must be utterly tabooed.</p>

<p>Taking these three principles as the basis
of our plans for our own particular House
Beautiful, let us consider how best we may
secure such. Our halls and kitchens are
perhaps the best instances of simplicity of
design. In them we seldom have more utensils
or articles than we need. Parquetry,
or inlaying with various-coloured wood, is
an ideal floor covering, even for our
modern narrow hall. Next to it ranks tiling,
and a plain linoleum is admissible. All these
secure cleanliness. Warmth must next be
suggested. To obtain this, we lay down rugs
of various colours and hang heavy curtains.
An oak chair, solid to look at (N.B.&mdash;Curves
in furniture should suggest repose, which is
out of place in a passage), a chest to hold
rugs and cloaks, a small, narrow mirror to
lighten up the gloom, and you have all that
is necessary. A few brass dishes on the
wall, a tall palm by one curtain, elks'
antlers, etc., are permissible where space is
obtainable. Do not, however, ever be tempted
to hang muslin in the alcove or to drape
with flimsy materials. Leave plenty of room
for visitors to pass in and out, without
finding entrance or exit blocked with exasperating
detail. Colour is what really redeems
a hall from monotony. This the wall-paper
and curtains and rugs should give without
help from trivial ornamentation.</p>

<p>Our kitchens are perhaps the most really
beautiful spots in our homes, if we take true
beauty to consist of absolute fitness for the
work to be done therein. The severe wooden
dresser, with its wide undershelf and commodious
cupboards, is as picturesque an
object as can be found. From time immemorial
its shape has been unaltered, and its
beauty consists in its suggestions of utility.
Traditional work is mostly beautiful, as
evidenced by the fact that the lines of a
plough have always been the admiration of
artists. Plainness is not ugliness, and the
dresser, glorified, is now one of the necessary
beauty spots even in our drawing-rooms.
Then those Windsor chairs, with their
slightly sloping backs and hollowed seats, are
restful to both eye and body. The bright
steel or copper range fitted with necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
knobs and useful doors is another example
of the beauty of fitness. In fact, both stove
and dresser are forms of truth and realism.</p>

<p>The two great faults to be avoided in the
dining-room of our House Beautiful are dreariness
and overcrowding. The French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">salle-&#224;-manger</i>
is really an ideal to work towards.
Unfortunately, few of us can consecrate the
parlour to meals alone; this living-room has
to serve many purposes. We should have it
as spacious, thou, and airy as possible. Round
tables have gone out of fashion, unfortunately;
yet the claw-leg pedestal table is the most
convenient, and consequently the most decorative,
of its kind. It economises space, and
is easily beautified. I have in memory a
dining-room I should like to see reproduced
in many a home. Just an ordinary square
chamber, with two straight windows looking
out on a lawn; a round table, its centre encircled
with flowers; a plain sideboard, guiltless
of plate-glass, but enlivened by old silver
wine coolers, napkin rings, and goblets; a
wide brass-bound fireplace with hobs; a high
mantelpiece, surrounded with a brazen grating;
a screen, and a few fine chairs. The beauty
of it&mdash;and it was very beautiful&mdash;consisted in
fitness for the end for which it was designed.
The walls were covered with a light-tinted
background for pictures (not with ornamental
garden stuff in perspective). Its heavy, rich
curtains hung by visible rings from a real
pole; its coal-scoop was of copper, not papier-mach&#233;
tinware; its cupboards full of glass
that might be wanted, and silver often called
for; its napery and napkins fine and fair; its
thick carpet guiltless of grating greens and
crude crimsons; its windows made to open,
and its iron-flanged door made to shut. There
was no meaningless or characterless ornamental
work about this old room; no inappropriate
decoration spoiled its well-designed and
well-constructed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</i>.</p>

<p>As I have sketched an ideal parlour, so
would I limn a bedroom I have seen. It was
a queer-shaped room, with rather high windows
set over some panelling in a little, crooked,
dome-shaped alcove, a tiny dressing-room
opened off it. The paper was yellow; the
paint all white. A bed with plain brass spindles
and rails stood away from draught and light,
headed with creamy chintz sprinkled with
Scotch rosebuds and lined with gold. The
curtains of shiny chintz hung from half-inch
brass rods only to the window-sill. A wide
box couch under them formed a restful seat.
Crossways stood a dressing-table, its toilet
glass flanked with brass candle-holders, and
its jewel drawers fitted with old beaten drop
handles; it, as well as the wardrobe, was
enamelled white. A frame screen of the same
purity, its yellow silk curtains dependent by
tiny rings from tiny rods, stood before the
dressing-room door, and effectually shut away
all washing apparatus. The floor of this room
was polished all over (kept in order by weekly
applications of beeswax and turpentine). On
it lay white Kurd and Scinde rugs. The
mantelpiece was wooden, and the chimney
corner decorated with shelves painted like
wainscotting and doors. These little shelves
supplied vantage-grounds for lots of blue-and-white
china, and though the colour-scheme
may sound monotonous, infinite variety was
introduced by the etceteras of the toilette.
Of course, blue or terra-cotta, carried out as
faithfully, would give an equally satisfactory
symphony of tint. However we may decorate
our bedrooms, we must not forget that space
and head-room are the two requisites for
health therein. Simplicity, careful keeping,
and radiant cleanliness should be the keynotes
of every bedroom in the House Beautiful.</p>

<p>In approaching the drawing-room, I feel I
am treading on difficult ground&mdash;in fact, an
impossible one. Abundantly diverse in everything
are some of the reception-rooms I
should call beautiful. Wide-mouth pickle jars
swathed in art muslin are positively wrong.
So are painted rolling-pins or banjos. As
to cardboard plaques representing china, and
paper frills cut out to look like lace&mdash;away
with them! A plain brown jug full of real
daisies is far more beautiful than a glass
bottle covered with varnished pictures and
filled with paper or silk imitations. One bit
of quaint crackle or Venetian ware on our
chimney-piece is restful to the eye; highly
coloured shams are distressful. "Although
we may tolerate insipid prettiness in perishable
confectionery, we ought not to do so
in objects which become associated with
our daily life." Power of design and power
of imitation are the two widely divergent
qualities of mind required to produce a beautiful
drawing-room. Ostentation of money
should be avoided here.</p>

<p>In concluding this paper, I should like
to remind my readers that all yearnings
after the beautiful are legitimate and right.
God has placed a love for the lovely in every
human heart. He Himself&mdash;in all reverence
be it spoken&mdash;has led the way. When designing
furniture for the Tabernacle built for glory
and for beauty in the far-away desert, He
made it in the most artistic, most serviceable,
and most simple of forms. Look at the description
of those golden candlesticks, with
their golden almond-shaped knops and elegant
branches. Think of the curtains of scarlet
and blue and purple, and fine twined linen.
Think of the snuffers and spoons and ouches,
and bolts and rings and staves, all of pure
gold. Truth and grace were evermore wedded
together in these patterns of the heavenly
things. "Go, and do thou likewise."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">November 20th.</span>&mdash;Manasseh's Sin and Repentance.</p>

<p><em>To read&mdash;2 Chron. xxxiii. 9-16. Golden Text&mdash;1
St. John i. 9.</em></p>

<p>Manasseh, son of good King Hezekiah, yet
for many years very wicked. Must have
been taught to do right by his father;
good seed sown, but choked by tares of sin
and worldliness; a long time before bore good fruit&mdash;not
till tares pulled out.</p>

<p>I. <strong>Manasseh's Sin</strong> (9-11). Only a boy of twelve
when began reign. Many would flatter and spoil.
Just an age to need good advice and guidance. But
many to lead him wrong, as other kings had been
led before him (xxiv. 17, 18). So he chose wrong.</p>

<p><em>Idolatry.</em> Undid all Hezekiah's work by building
up again altars for Baal (ver. 3); even set up idol in
house of God itself (ver. 7), besides seeking counsel
from witches, etc. (ver. 6), instead of God. Sinned worse
than heathen, for he knew right, which they did not.</p>

<p><em>Punishment.</em> God tried remonstrances, probably by
prophets, but in vain. His heart and his people's
hardened against God by sin; so God sent captains
of King of Assyria, who took him prisoner, and carried
him bound in chains to Babylon, capital of Assyria.</p>

<p>II. <strong>Manasseh's Repentance</strong> (12-16). <em>The captive.</em>
The King, far from home, in strange land; what does
he think about? His <em>father</em>&mdash;how little he has copied
his example; his <em>home</em>&mdash;how he has forfeited it; his
<em>life</em>&mdash;how wicked it has been; his <em>companions</em>&mdash;how
they have led him astray; his <em>God</em>&mdash;he has sinned too
deeply&mdash;can he possibly be forgiven?</p>

<p><em>The repentance.</em> What does he do? He humbles
himself&mdash;first step in true repentance, he confesses
his sin as David did (Ps. xxxii. 5); he asks forgiveness;
he promises amendment. Was such prayer
ever in vain? (Golden Text).</p>

<p><em>The restoration.</em> Sent back to his throne; became
prosperous; fortified the cities. Best of all, put away
idols, repaired Temple, offered sacrifices; did all in
his power to undo effects of his former sin. Commanded
the people to serve God.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson.</strong> How to repent. Ask for true sorrow.
Confess to God all sin. Seek grace to change life.</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>Repentance.</h3>

<p>A man of the world, who had spent the greater part
of his life in dissipation, was converted to God. He
gave up all his property, and went to live with a
well-known clergyman in Cornwall. There he devoted
himself entirely to the service of Christ. One day he
met a miner whom he had long been trying to bring to
repentance. He persuaded him to enter the church;
and there, kneeling side by side, they prayed for a long
time, not ceasing till the miner felt a sense of the
greatness of his sin and of the pardoning love of God.
Many other souls was he the means of bringing back to
God. There was joy in heaven over that repentant
sinner as there was over Manasseh.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">November 27th.</span>&mdash;A Temperance Lesson.</p>

<p><em>To read&mdash;Prov. iv. 10-19. Golden Text&mdash;Ver. 10.</em></p>

<p>This book, written by Solomon, contains a selection
of his numerous "proverbs" or wise sayings. The
early chapters are especially intended for the young,
and are in praise of "wisdom," the practical carrying
out of knowledge.</p>

<p>I. <strong>The Blessing of Wisdom</strong> (10-13). <em>Long life</em>
often promised as the result of a godly life, <em>e.g.</em> to
those who honour parents (fifth commandment); also
to those who obey God (Deut. xxx. 20).</p>

<p><em>Right paths</em>, <em>i.e.</em> right dealing with men, <em>e.g.</em>
Abraham paying for burying-place (Gen. xxiii. 13);
David in all his life (2 Sam. xxii. 21).</p>

<p><em>No stumbling.</em> Life like a narrow path. A man
burdened by sin walks, as it were, with shackles on
legs. A Christian is held up by God's arms (Deut.
xxxiii. 27); kept from stumbling to his ruin.</p>

<p><em>Eternal life.</em> Wisdom (i. 20) personified as Christ,
the Divine Word, in Whom is all knowledge (Col. ii.
3). To know Him is everlasting life (St. John xvii. 3).</p>

<p>II. <strong>The Folly of Wickedness</strong> (14-17). <em>Sin to be
avoided.</em> Remind of Eve: of Lot choosing to live
in wicked Sodom. The disastrous results: Eve
turned out of Paradise&mdash;Lot losing home and wife.</p>

<p><em>Sin grows.</em> Evil takes such hold that some prefer
it to good&mdash;day and night plan evil, <em>e.g.</em> thieves,
drunkards, etc., and take pleasure in leading others
wrong.</p>

<p>III. <strong>Results.</strong> <em>The just.</em> A Christian's course like
the light, increasing from early dawn till full light of
noon. Perfection, not all at once. Good seed brings
forth fruit "with patience," <em>i.e.</em> gradually (St. Luke
viii. 15). Christ increased in wisdom as He grew
taller and older (St. Luke ii. 52). So we must "grow
in grace and knowledge." The more a Christian
knows of God, the more clearly does God's light
show itself in him.</p>

<p><em>The wicked.</em> Are in darkness, and so stumble.
Sin blinds their eyes (St. John xii. 35); they
confuse right and wrong. Example: Saul, blinded
by prejudice against Jesus of Nazareth, thought he
did God service when he persecuted the Christians.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p><strong>Lessons.</strong> 1. Awake, thou that sleepest, arise from
the dead, and Christ shall give thee light!</p>

<p>2. Open Thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous
things out of Thy law.</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>The Toil and Folly of Sin.</h3>

<p>There was a man in a certain town who used, till he
was caught, to steal all his firewood. He would get up
on cold nights and prowl around, helping himself from
the well-stacked piles. A calculation was made, and it
was found that he had worked harder and spent more
time to get fuel in this way than if he had earned it
honestly by hard work. One day he was caught in the
act of theft, and was sentenced to three months' imprisonment.
"The way of transgressors is hard."</p></blockquote>

<p>I. <strong>The Book Found</strong> (8&mdash;14). <em>The place.</em> Temple
found in great disorder. Amon, the last King, in two
years had done much evil&mdash;idolatry again. Now
Temple cleansed under superintendence of Hilkiah,
high priest. Rubbish turned over; large "roll of a
book" discovered. What can it be? The authentic
copy of Law of God, <em>i.e.</em> books of Moses, kept near
the Ark in the Holy of Holies. What a find!</p>

<p><em>The scribes.</em> Two scribes, readers and keepers of
the Law, with Hilkiah when the roll was found.
They read it themselves; one of them, Shaphan, takes
it to the King; reports the collection made for the
repairs, how the work is going on, and the discovery.
He reads the book aloud. The King much moved by
the words of the Law and God's wrath against sinners
(Deut. xxix. 27). Sends to Huldah the prophetess
to inquire further of the Lord. He sees how little
the words of the book have been obeyed.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson.</strong> The Word of God is quick and powerful.</p>

<p>II. <strong>God's Message to Josiah</strong> (15&mdash;20). As in time
of Judges, when Deborah was prophetess (Judges iv.
4), God speaks by a woman; double message.</p>

<p><em>To the people.</em> A terrible punishment, as foretold in
the Law, because of their sin. Had forsaken God&mdash;turned
aside to other gods. Had not repented, therefore
His wrath kindled against them.</p>

<p><em>To Josiah.</em> His heart was humble; attended to
God's message; he did weep for the people's sin. God
has heard him&mdash;he shall be spared. The judgment
shall not come in his time; his end shall be peace.</p>

<p><strong>Lessons.</strong> 1. God ever the same. He <em>must</em> punish
sin. He <em>will</em> deliver the just.</p>

<p>2. As then, so now, He sends warning by His Book,
His ministers, and teachers.</p>

<p>3. Why will ye die? Return unto the Lord.</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>The Bible a Delight.</h3>

<p>One day, when walking through Wales, Mr. Hone, the
author, stopped at a cottage door and found a little girl
reading the Bible. He asked for a glass of water, which
was quickly brought to him. Getting into conversation
with the girl, he asked her how she liked learning her
task out of the Bible. "Oh," she said, "it is not a task
to read it; I love it." Seeing his surprise, she added,
"I thought everybody loved the Bible." The arrow
went home. Hone pondered over her remark and began
to read the Bible for himself, and from that time read
the sacred book constantly. Before long, instead of
being an opponent of the Bible, he became one of its
strongest defenders, for he, like the child, had learned
to love it.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">December 11th.</span>&mdash;Trying to Destroy God's Word.</p>

<p><em>To read&mdash;Jer. xxxvi. 20-32. Golden Text&mdash;Isaiah
xl. 8.</em></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Josiah</span> the last godly King. At his death
Jerusalem fell back into corruption. Jeremiah the
prophet warns in vain of coming destruction&mdash;is
hated by nobles&mdash;imprisoned by King; bids Baruch
write God's words in a roll of a book (ver. 6).</p>

<p>I. <strong>The Roll Read</strong> (ver. 20). Hitherto Jeremiah
spoke his prophecies. Why written now? To be
read in various places while he was shut up (ver. 5),
and kept for our instruction. Great excitement this
day in Jerusalem. Large assembly of people heard&mdash;princes
heard and were afraid (ver. 16); King
Jehoiachim is told of it. Courtiers round the King
tell him what they recollect of the warnings; he is
interested&mdash;perhaps alarmed. Sends for the roll,
hidden in the council chamber.</p>

<p>II. <strong>The Roll Burned</strong> (21-26). Picture the King
sitting in his study; bright wood fire on the hearth
in the winter-house. Jehudi sent to fetch roll.
Nobles and other courtiers stand around; the roll
is read. The King is angry; after hearing three or
four columns he stops the reader, cuts the roll into
pieces with penknife, flings them on the fire. Some
of princes approve; three try to stop him. The
parchment crackles, roll is destroyed. Baruch the
scribe and Jeremiah ordered to be imprisoned. Is all
over? King could destroy roll, but not God's Word.</p>

<p>III. <strong>The Roll Re-written</strong> (26-32). King's efforts
all in vain. Man fights in vain against God. King
despises the prophecy. Another roll written; more
severe judgments. God laughs him to scorn. This
is his punishment:&mdash;The King shall have no heir to
succeed him. He shall have a dishonoured death&mdash;no
burial. The whole nation shall be severely punished.
King of Babylon shall take the people captive.</p>

<p><strong>Lessons.</strong> 1. God's Word shall not return void.</p>

<p>2. The folly of trying to resist God.</p>

<p>3. The certainty of coming judgment for sin.</p>

<blockquote>

<h3>God's Word True.</h3>

<p>A man and his wife became possessed of a Bible,
which they had never read before. The man began to
read it, and, one night, as he sat by the fire with the
open book, he said, "Wife, if this book is right, we are
wrong." He continued reading, and a few days afterwards
he said, "Wife, if this book is right, we are lost!"
More eager than ever to see what the Word of the
Lord was, he continued to study the book, until one
night he joyfully exclaimed, "Wife, if this book is true,
we are saved!" This is the glory of God's Word; it
tells of sin and punishment, but it tells also of salvation.
King Jehoiachim, hearing God's Word, tried to
destroy it and was lost; but King Josiah, hearing it,
turned to God and was saved.</p></blockquote>

<h3>The Real Winners.</h3>

<p>A hurried and unceremonious burial is often
all that can be given to the dead after a great
battle. They are the harvest of war; but the
dead, though in comparison to the living victors
they may be said to be at least unhonoured,
have often been the real winners of the battle.
It was over their dead bodies or over the way
they made that the survivors rushed to victory.
So it is that when we allow self to die we accomplish
most Christian work and win the fight of
faith.</p>

<h3>For Prizes or Presents.</h3>

<p>There are already many indications that the
Christmas festival is slowly but surely drawing
near, and not the least significant is the deluge of
new stories suitable for presents and prizes which
has already commenced. To many a boy and girl
Christmas would lose half its charms if it did not
bring with it a new story from old favourites, such as
Gordon Stables, Emma Marshall, or G. A. Henty, and
the young people will not be disappointed this year.
Messrs. Nisbet have just issued Dr. Stables's latest
story, which he has entitled "Off to Klondyke." Its
very title is suggestive of exciting experiences at the
fascinating goldfields of the Yukon, and many boys&mdash;both
young and old&mdash;will follow with breathless
interest the numerous wonderful adventures which
are related therein. From the same publishers
comes an equally interesting story of an English
boy's adventures in the great French War under
the expressive title "Face to Face with Napoleon."
There is plenty of romantic incident in this story,
and as the author, Mr. O. V. Caine, has carefully
verified the historical portions of the work, it will serve
the double purpose of entertaining and instructing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Our old friend, Mrs. Emma Marshall, is to the fore
with an excellent story for girls, entitled "Under
the Laburnum Tree" (Nisbet and Co.), which will
be eagerly welcomed in many a home and school.&mdash;The
last volume before us is entitled "Yule Logs,"
and is edited for Messrs. Longmans by Mr. G. A.
Henty. Unlike the books previously mentioned,
this does not contain a single long story, but is
made up of a series of short stories by such well-known
writers as Henry Frith, Manville Fenn,
John Bloundelle-Burton, and, of course, the editor
himself. The stories deal with extraordinary
adventures on land and sea, in both ancient
and modern times, and are of such variety as to
satisfy the most exacting reader.</p>


<h3>"Mousie."</h3>

<p>A poor little lad died a few weeks ago in a narrow
and crowded street of Central London after four
years of terrible suffering from hip disease. His
sweet and uncomplaining nature endeared him
in a particular way to the friends who visited
him, and one of them has taken a picture of him,
as he sat up in bed, surrounded by his flowers
and small comforts, not long before his death.
"Mousie" got his pet name from the doctors at a
big hospital, who were so struck by his gentleness,
and by the quiet courage with which he endured
his painful operations. He had been originally
knocked down by a cab, and his feeble constitution
never recovered from the accident. Once, to his
great delight, he was well enough to attend a
meeting of the Ministering Children's League, of
which he was a member. He was supported on
a table, and helped to make a cushion for a sick
old woman. But he was soon obliged to keep
to his room and his couch altogether. Even then
"Mousie" was often thinking of others. "Can't
I do a toy for some poor child who has none?" he
would say, and with the wool that was given him
he would make balls for babies. "It is not Jesus
who sends me this pain," he once explained to the
friend who pens this brief memory of him; "He
is far too kind: it was my own fault for getting
in the way of the cab." Poor "Mousie"! he was
only ten years old, but he had his own solution of
the mystery of pain. He loved to hear hymns.
Someone sang "There is a Happy Land" to him
the night before he died, and a little later those
who were watching him were surprised to hear
him croon the first verse all through in quite a
strong clear, voice. Then he sighed pitifully,
"Lord Jesus, do take me!" and said to his mother,
"I shan't have a bit of pain <em>there</em>, you know!" And
after a few unconscious hours "Mousie" knew
why God had permitted his pain.</p>

<h3>Always Rejoicing.</h3>

<p>When, in 1849, the American author, Nathaniel
Hawthorne, was dismissed from being a surveyor,
his wife thus writes of the supposed calamity in
a letter to her mother: "It has come in the way
of an inevitable providence to us (whatever
knavery some people may have to answer for
who have been the agents in the removal), and I
never receive inevitable providences with resignation
merely, but with <em>joy</em>, as certainly, undoubtedly,
the best possible events that can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
happen for me." Surely this is the right way to
regard the changes and so-called chances of this
mortal life, if we believe that our Heavenly Father
orders the lives of each one of us with individual
care.</p>

<p>THE QUIVER GOOD CONDUCT PRIZE WINNERS, 1898.</p></div>
</div>


<h3>An Interesting Group.</h3>

<p>The Quiver Prize has long since become an
annual institution in several representative orphanages,
and as our object is to encourage honesty,
industry, and general good conduct, it is awarded
each year to those inmates who have shown greatest
progress in these respects during the preceding
twelve months. We publish a group of the winners
for 1898, who represent respectively the Orphan
Working School, the Reedham Orphanage, The
Gordon Boys' Home, and the National Refuges.</p>

<h2>THE QUIVER SANTA CLAUS.</h2>


<p>The children's festival&mdash;as the Christmas
season is rightly called&mdash;is already within
the horizon of preparation. A few weeks
more, and our young people will be enjoying
the delights of Yule-tide, not the least of
which is the perennial Christmas Stocking. Most
of us remember the eager&mdash;almost feverish&mdash;anticipation
with which we tied up our little
stocking at the head of our small bed, in the full
faith that the mysterious but kindly visitant of
Christmas Eve would cram into it all sorts of lovely
things; and how when morning dawned, our first
thought was to reach it down to our pillow and
explore its wonderful recesses. But there are
thousands of little children to whom these raptures
are unknown. They do not appear to have been
put upon Santa Claus's visiting list; and it seems
hard that this venerable gentleman should pass
them over. These poor and friendless little ones,
to be found in every town and in many of our
villages, want a kind-hearted neighbour who will
mention their names and addresses to that genial
but omniscient saint, and then, presto! there's joy
for a forlorn little chap or maiden "on Christmas
Day in the morning." We therefore earnestly
invite all fathers and mothers, and uncles and
aunts, and all who love to see the children glad on
the Saviour's birthday, to co-operate with us in
providing Christmas stockings for those forlorn
youngsters, into whose life scarcely a ray of brightness
ever enters. Not much is needed to give them
this boon by way of the Christmas stocking. A
few wholesome goodies and a simple toy will
amply suffice to supply them with a fund of innocent
excitement and enjoyment. A sum of one shilling
will furnish a stocking and pay the postage, when
combined in a large contract. We have the happiness
to announce that the proprietors of <span class="smcap">The
Quiver</span> have kindly consented to head our subscription
list with a sum sufficient to provide the
contents of</p>

<h3>
FIVE HUNDRED CHRISTMAS STOCKINGS FOR POOR<br />
AND FRIENDLESS CHILDREN.</h3>

<p>This is a good start, but this number will be
quite inadequate to the innumerable demands
which are sure to be made upon us. We therefore
earnestly ask for further contributions from
all child-lovers who would sorely regret to see
any tiny mite left disappointed on Christmas Day.</p>

<p>We shall also be glad to receive recommendations
from our readers (as before in the case of our
Christmas Hamper Fund) of suitable cases for the
supply of stockings. The special forms for this
purpose will be supplied in our Extra Christmas
Number, and if filled up in accordance with the
directions there given will be dealt with in the
order in which they reach the Editor, as far as
the funds will permit. All contributions to the
Christmas Stocking Fund should be sent to the
Editor of <span class="smcap">The Quiver</span>, La Belle Sauvage, London,
E.C., and all amounts of one shilling and upwards
will be thankfully acknowledged in our pages.</p>


<h4>Special Presentation Plate.</h4>

colours, of Mr. W. Holman Hunt's great picture,
"The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple," is
